# Product Growth Report: Sprint 2 & Sprint 3
**Date**: January 2026
**Focus**: Vertical Expansion (Founder Mode) & Drafting Capabilities

## 📈 Executive Summary: How We've Grown

Over the last two sprints, **NyayaFlow** has evolved from a tool purely for legal professionals ("Advocate Mode") into a dual-persona platform that also serves early-stage founders ("Founder Mode").

This expansion significantly increases our **Total Addressable Market (TAM)** by opening up the platform to the millions of SMB owners and startup founders in India who need legal guidance but cannot afford full-time counsel.

    -   **Impact**: Non-lawyers can fill complex forms with confidence.

3.  **Magic Auto-Fill (Context Aware)**:
