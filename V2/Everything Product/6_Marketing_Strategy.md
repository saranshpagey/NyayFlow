## 🏗️ 3-Phase Marketing Roadmap

### Phase 1: Validated Trust (The "Digital Munshi" Campaign)
**Goal**: Get the first 1,000 "Evangelist" users who vouch for our accuracy.
*   **Target**: District Court Advocates in Tier 2 cities (Lucknow, Pune, Jaipur).
*   **Tactic**: **WhatsApp Penetration**.
    *   Create "High-Utility PDF Assets" (e.g., "Checklist for filing 138 NI Act Case in 2024").
    *   Brand them minimally with NyayaFlow logo + QR code.
    *   Circulate in "Bar Association" WhatsApp groups.
*   **Incentive**: "Scan QR for 1 Month Pro Free".
*   **Target B (Founders)**: Early-stage Startup Communities (YCombinator India, Twitter/X).
    *   **Tactic**: "Legal Health Check" Tool.
    *   **Process**: "Upload your NDA -> AI scores it for risk -> Get NyayaFlow safe template."

### Phase 2: SEO Dominance (The "Legal Encyclopedia" Library)
**Goal**: Capture High-Intent Search Traffic.
*   **Strategy**: "Programmatic SEO" for legal maxims and sections.
    *   **Page Type A**: "Section [X] [Act] Explained" (e.g., "Section 420 IPC Explained").
    *   **Page Type B**: "Format of [Y]" (e.g., "Format of Divorce Petition").
*   **Conversion Loop**:
    *   User lands on "Format of Divorce Petition".
    *   Sees static text.
    *   Popup: "Want to customize this for your client in 2 clicks? [Try Smart Drafter]".

### Phase 3: Viral Loops (The "Shareable Precedent")
**Goal**: Product-led Growth.
*   **Feature**: "Share Case Summary".
    *   Advocate finds a great judgment on NyayaFlow.
    *   Clicks "Share on WhatsApp".
    *   Recipient allows to view the summary on a branded web page (NyayaFlow.com/s/xyz).
    *   Recipient sees "Powered by NyayaFlow" -> Sign Up.
