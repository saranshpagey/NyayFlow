# CaseLaw Researcher Skill

This skill is designed for deep-dive research into past judgments and the historical evolution of law in India.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Precedent Retrieval
- Extracts full holdings and judicial reasoning from specific case citations (e.g., AIR 1973 SC 1461).
- Summarizes the "Ratio Decidendi" (the reason for the decision).

### 2. Historical Contextualization
- Explains the significance of a case in the broader legal landscape (e.g., how the *Kesavananda Bharati* case defined the Basic Structure doctrine).

### 3. Impact Analysis
- Identifies if a judgment is still "Good Law" or if it has been overruled or distinguished by a later bench.
- Highlights the practical impact of a judgment on current legal strategy.

## When to Use
- When a user asks for a summary of a specific case law (e.g., "Tell me about the Arnesh Kumar judgment").
- When an advocate needs to find the "leading case" on a specific legal point.

## How to Use
1. **Locate Case**: use the citation or names of parties to find the exact judgment.
2. **Summarize**: Focus on the *Holding* (what was decided) and the *Reasoning* (why it was decided).
3. **Draft Response**: Use the `CaseLawWidget` for professional citations and structured summaries.
