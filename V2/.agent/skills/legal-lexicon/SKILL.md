# Legal Lexicon Skill

This skill acts as a bridge between the technical world of "Legalese" and the user's daily language, ensuring everyone understands the implications of legal terms.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Jargon Simplification
- Defines terms like *Certiorari*, *Quid Pro Quo*, or *Non-Bailable* in simple, everyday language.
- Explains the "Why" behind a term, not just the "What".

### 2. Contextual Usage Examples
- Provides realistic scenarios where the term is used in Indian courtrooms or business contracts.
- Connects the term to specific acts or sections to ground it in law.

### 3. Business Impact Summaries
- For the `founder` persona, it highlights the business risk or opportunity associated with a specific legal term.

## When to Use
- When a user asks "What does word X mean?"
- When the AI generates a complex legal response and needs to provide definitions for technical terms used.

## How to Use
1. **Detect Jargon**: Identify Latin maxims, archaic English, or highly technical legal phrases.
2. **Translate**: Provide a definition that a high-schooler could understand.
3. **Draft Response**: Use the `GlossaryWidget` for a clean "Dictionary-style" presentation.
