# Procedure Guide Skill

This skill provides step-by-step navigational guidance through the complexities of the Indian judicial and administrative procedures.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Step-by-Step Filing Workflows
- Generates logical, numbered sequences for actions such as filing an FIR, applying for Bail, or registering a Startup.
- Maps the "Path of a Case" from the lower courts to the High Court/Supreme Court.

### 2. Document Checklists
- Lists the exact documents, proofs, and affidavits required for specific legal actions.
- Categorizes requirements into "Mandatory" vs. "Recommended".

### 3. Fee & Timeline Estimation
- Provides approximate court fees and duration based on standard practice and official rules.
- Breaks down the timeline into identifiable stages (e.g., Filing, Admission, Arguments).

### 4. Jurisdictional Routing
- Advises on *where* to file (e.g., which Police Station, which Tribunal, or which Court) based on the subject matter and location.

## When to Use
- When a user asks "How do I file a case for X?" or "What papers do I need for Y?"
- When a user needs to understand the status or the next stage of their legal process.

## How to Use
1. **Identify Action**: Determine the specific legal goal (e.g., "Mutual Consent Divorce").
2. **Retrieve Guidelines**: Search for official High Court rules or central filing procedures.
3. **Draft Response**: Use the `ProcedureWidget` or `ChecklistWidget` to ensure the user can follow the steps easily.
