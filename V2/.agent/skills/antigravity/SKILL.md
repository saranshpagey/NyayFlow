# Antigravity Legal Tech Engine

This skill encapsulates the high-level capabilities of the NyayaFlow platform, focusing on the infrastructure and product-level intelligence that supports the specialized agents.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Multi-Persona Legal Strategy
- Optimizes the entire system behavior for the **Founder persona** (decision-centric) vs. the **Advocate persona** (statutory-centric).
- Manages global state variables like `activeSessionId` and `targetPersona`.

### 2. High-Fidelity Knowledge Base (RAG)
- Governs the ingestion of official legislative gazettes and judgments from sources like *Indian Kanoon*.
- Manages the semantic cache and vector search thresholds for the entire backend.

### 3. Generative UI Infrastructure
- Defines the schemas for all interactive legal widgets (Statute Cards, Outcome Predictions, etc.).
- Ensures seamless integration of AI reasoning into real-time drafting previews.

### 4. System-Wide Safety & Safety Badge
- Oversees the global safety protocols, including confidence scoring and jurisdiction-specific warnings.
- Manages the "Lawyer Handoff" logic for high-risk legal queries.

## When to Use
- Use this skill when the workspace requires architectural guidance, RAG maintenance, or overall product vision alignment.
- Use it to manage the transition between project-wide "Generative UI" goals and specific legal agent tasks.
