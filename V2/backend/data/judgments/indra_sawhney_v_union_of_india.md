W.P.(C).No.16212 of 2009

Dated this the 12th day of June, 2009.
JUDGMENT
I heard learned counsel for the petitioner
and learned Government Pleader and learned
standing counsel for the KSRTC. By consent of
parties, the writ petition is heard and disposed of.
2. The petitioner, an existing operator on
the route Angamali-Mukkannoor-Munnoorppilly-
Perumbavoor, sought for a variation of the route
initially by seeking permission to operate with an
additional trip as also curtailment. The application
was rejected. The matter was taken up before the
Tribunal.
3. Before the Tribunal, the petitioner gave
up his prayer for an additional trip. The Tribunal
passed the following order on Ext.P7:
"In the result, this appeal is allowed
and setting aside the impugned order, the
matter is remanded directing the 1st
W.P.(C).No.16212 of 2009
:: 2 ::
respondent to grant the variation as sought
for by the appellant, if the appellant files a
modified proposal without insisting the
additional trip claimed in the original
proposal, within a period of 30 days from the
date of this order."
4. Pursuant to Ext.P7, the petitioner filed
filed a modified proposal without insisting on the
additional trip. The Regional Transport Authority
then proceeded to pass the following order as per
Ext.P9:
"Heard. Perused the judgment and
considered. There is public representation
regarding curtailment of the existing route
10.4 km which will adversely affect the
existing passengers. Hence variation
granted without curtailment subject to
settlement of timing and road fitness
certificate from PWD Authorities."
5. Thus, though a variation has been
granted, the same was without curtailment and
settlement of timings. Ext.P9 has been challenged in
this writ petition.
W.P.(C).No.16212 of 2009
:: 3 ::
6. The Regional Transport Authority is
bound by the orders of the appellate authority. The
appellate tribunal has, in Ext.P7, directed the
Regional Transport Authority to grant a variation as
sought for by the appellant, if the appellant files a
modified proposal. It cannot be disputed that the
petitioner gave up the additional trip as originally
proposed by him. The variation, which therefore
came up for consideration before the Regional
Transport Authority pursuant to Ext.P7, was only a
variation with curtailment. This, the Regional
Transport Authority was bound to allow, as long as
Ext.P7 stood. In such circumstances, the Regional
Transport Authority was not entitled to proceed at
variance from the order passed by the State
Transport Appellate Tribunal.
7. The position has been fortified and a
similar view has been taken in Ext.P10.
W.P.(C).No.16212 of 2009
:: 4 ::
In the result, the writ petition is allowed.
Ext.P9 is set aside, to the extent to which the
Regional Transport Authority has granted variation
without curtailment. The Regional Transport
Authority shall pass fresh orders in the matter of
variation, as sought for by the petitioner and directed
in Ext.P7 within three weeks from the date of receipt
of a copy of this judgment and the varied permit will
be issued, subject to settlement of timings.
