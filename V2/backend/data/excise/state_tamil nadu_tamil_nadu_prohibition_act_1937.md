Patna High Court - Orders
Harendra Yadav vs The State Of Bihar on 23 August, 2011
IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT PATNA
Cr.Misc. No.28259 of 2011
Harendra Yadav, son of Banwari Yadav, village Nai Bazar, PS Buxar (T), Dist. Buxar -
Petitioner.
Versus
The State Of Bihar
-----------
2 23.8.2011
Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and the
counsel appearing on behalf of the State.
The petitioner is said to have fired on the deceased
which resulted in his death.
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the
informant is accused in cases under sections 307 and 302 of the
Penal Code (Annexures 2 and 3). It is submitted that actually
unknown persons killed the deceased. Because of the fact that
petitioner is a witness in the aforesaid two cases, he has been
implicated in the present case.
I am not inclined to grant bail to the petitioner at this
stage. This application is dismissed.
