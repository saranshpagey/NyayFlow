Parmanand & Others vs State Of U.P. & Another on 11 August, 2010
Author:

Bench:
S.C. Agarwal
Court No. - 50
Case :- CRIMINAL REVISION No. - 3162 of 2010
Petitioner :- Parmanand & Others
Respondent :- State Of U.P. & Another
Petitioner Counsel :- Ramesh Sinha
Respondent Counsel :- Govt. Advocate
Hon'ble S.C. Agarwal,J.
Heard learned counsel for the revisionists and learned AGA.
There is no need to issue notice to O.P. No.2.
This revision is directed against the judgment and order dated
9.7.2010 passed by Addl. Sessions Judge, F.T.C. No.2, Gautam
Budh Nagar in S.T. No. 423 of 2009, under
Sections 147
,
148
,
149
,
307
,
302
,
504
,
506
,
34
IPC, and
Section 7
Criminal Law
Amendment Act, P.S. Badalpur, District - Gautam Budh Nagar
whereby the revisionists were summoned under
Section 319
Cr.P.C. to face trial.
Learned counsel for the revisionists submitted that learned trial
court had summoned the revisionists on the ground that there was
sufficient evidence against the revisionists. It is submitted that
learned trial court has not recorded his satisfaction that there exists
a possibility that the accused so summoned, in all likelihood,
would be convicted.
In
Mohd. Shafi Vs. Mohd. Rafiq and another
, 2007 (58) ACC
254, the Apex Court had held that before a Court exercising its
discretionary jurisdiction in terms of
Section 319
Cr.P.C., it must
arrive at the satisfaction that there exists a possibility that the
accused so summoned, is in all likelihood, liable to be convicted.
In
Sarabjit Singh & another Vs. State of Punjab & another
,
(2010) 2 Supreme Court Cases (Cri) 141, the Apex Court held
that for excercising extra ordinary jurisdiction under
section 319
Cr.P.C., the Courts are required to apply stringent tests; one of the
test being whether evidence on record is such which would
reasonably lead to conviction of the person sought to be
summoned and mere existence of a prima facie case may not serve
the purpose.
Since learned trial court has not recorded his satisfaction as above,
the impugned order cannot be sustained and is liable to be set
aside.
The criminal revision is allowed and the impugned order dated
9.7.2010 passed by Addl. Sessions Judge, F.T.C. No.2, Gautam
Budh Nagar is set aside. The learned Sessions Judge is directed to
decide the application under
Section 319
Cr.P.C. afresh in
accordance with the directions of the Apex Court in the cases of
Mohd. Shafi
(supra) and
Sarabjit
(supra).
Order Date :- 11.8.2010
