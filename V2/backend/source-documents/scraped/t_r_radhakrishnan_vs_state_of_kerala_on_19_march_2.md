=========================
W.P.(C)NO.22023 OF 2007
=========================
Dated this the 19th day of March 2008
JUDGMENT
The petitioner submits that he has been working as an
Animal Keeper on daily wage basis in the Thiruvananthapuram
Zoo since 1993. Ext.P1 certificate is referred to by him to show
that he has got zoo experience as Animal Keeper, on daily wages,
for the last 10 years. He has proved his mettle and expertise in
handling and looking after different varieties of monkeys and he
has got special knowledge in that field. Taking note of this
experience, the petitioner sought for regualrisation in the post of
Animal Keeper. His request was recommended by the Director in
Exts.P2, P3 and P4. Petitioner also referred to Exts.P5 and P6
orders passed by the Government in the case of two other
persons in the Thiruvananthapuram zoo, who were directed to be
appointed as full time animal keepers. Taking note of their
earlier provisional service and their expertise, one in handling
rare species of snakes and the other in handling Giraffes,
petitioner's claim was directed to be considered by the
W.P.(c)22023/2007 2
Government as per Ext.P8 judgment. Taking note of the
observations and the Supreme Court judgment in the case of
State of Kerala v Umadevi
(2006(4) SCC 1), the claim was
considered by the Government, but rejected under Ext.P9 which
has been challenged in the writ petition.
2. A counter affidavit has been filed by the respondents. It
is inter alia pointed out that the petitioner has intermittently
worked on daily wages from 1993. Regularisation of daily wage
workers will adversely affect the aspiration of the candidates,
who have registered their names in the Employment Exchange.
Petitioner claims experience in the field of looking after Monkeys
for which there is no dearth of experienced keepers in the Zoo.
Exts.P5 and P6 were issued in exceptional cases, when
experienced Animal Keepers were lacking in the zoo to look after
the deadly Venomous Cobra and the awesome Giraffe. The
situation is different in the case of different varieties of Monkeys.
3. I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and
the learned Government Pleader. The question is whether Ext.P9
order reveals any error of jurisdiction or illegality warranting
interference by this Court. Admittedly, the petitioner has been
W.P.(c)22023/2007 3
engaged only on daily wages. No doubt, he has acquired an
expertise in handling different varieties of Monkeys, going by
Exts.P3 and P4, but there is a method of appointment prescribed
for the post in question as per the special rules. This Court
cannot issue a direction to the Government to necessarily deviate
from the rules for regularising the services of daily wage
employees.
4. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that he is
situated on a par with the beneficiaries of Exts.P5 and P6. There
is no reason why his expertise should not be taken into account.
In my view, sufficient reasons have been given by the first
respondent in paragraph-4 of the counter affidavit to justify a
different treatment. At any rate, even if it is assumed that there
is any illegality in Exts.P5 and P6 the same will not afford any
enforceable right as far as the petitioner is concerned. For all
these reasons, I do not find any reason to interfere with Ext.P9.
But it is made clear that if the expertise of the petitioner in
handling different varieties of Monkeys is found to be a benefit to
the Zoo in Thiruvananthapuram or in any other Zoo coming
under the Department of Zoos and Museums, then it is open to
W.P.(c)22023/2007 4
the third respondent to avail the expertise of the petitioner. I also
make it clear that the judgment will not stand in the way of the
petitioner being considered as an Animal Keeper on daily wages
and if the services of Animal Keepers are required, I am sure
that the Director shall look into the previous experience of the
petitioner as a factor in his favour.
The writ petition is disposed of as above.
