Summary
Draft Article 282A (Article 310 of the Constitution of India 1950) was not included in the Draft Constitution 1948. It was introduced by the Drafting Committee Chairman on
7 September 1949
. It specified the tenure of office for civil servants of the Union and States and members of the defence services. It stated that these officers would hold office based on the discretion of the President of India or the Governor of the State respectively. The Draft Article also provided that any person who is not a member of the all-India civil services or defence services and is appointed under a specific contract would be compensated if their services are terminated without any fault of the service provider.
A Member
proposed
to amend the Draft Article to limit the tenure of such officers till they attain the age of 68 instead of leaving it to the discretion of the President of India. However, he
withdrew
this amendment and instead suggested that the discretion should lie with the President for services at the State-level as well, in place of the Governor. There was no further discussion on this Draft Article and it was
adopted
on the same day
