SUMMARY
Draft Article 310 was discussed in the Constituent Assembly on
1
0 October 1949
. This transitional provision ensured that those who were judges of Provincial High Courts would continue to be judges of the same High Courts in the corresponding States after the Constitution came into force. They would also be entitled to salaries, allowances, leave and pensions as provided under Article 197 of the Draft Constitution.
One Member
did not
see
the need for such a provision: it was clear that Provincial High Court judges would continue to be judges of the same high courts after the Constitution came into effect.  He
added
that there was no such provision for other public officers. He
suggested
that this provision’s covert motivation was to reduce the pay of existing High Court judges.  He
moved
an amendment to keep the salaries, allowances, leave and pension of these judges the same as they were before the Constitution was enacted.
The Drafting Committee Chairman
argued
that the member’s amendment was more relevant to Schedule II of the Draft Constitution, which lays down in detail the salary, allowances etc., of High Court judges.
An amendment was moved by t
he Drafting Committee Chairman to add that judges of the High Courts in Princely States would also continue to be judges in the High Courts of the respective States once the Constitution was enacted.
The Assembly
adopted
the Draft Article as amended by the Drafting Committee Chairman on 10 October 1949.
