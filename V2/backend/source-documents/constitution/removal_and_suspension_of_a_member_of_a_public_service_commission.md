(1) Subject to the provisions of clause (3), the Chairman or any other member of a Public Service Commission shall only be removed from his office by order of the President on the ground of misbehaviour after the Supreme Court, on reference being made to it by the President, has, on inquiry held in accordance with the procedure prescribed in that behalf under article 145, reported that the Chairman or such other member, as the case may be, ought on any such ground to be removed.
(2) The President, in the case of the Union Commission or a Joint Commission, and the Governor in the case of a State Commission, may suspend from office the Chairman or any other member of the Commission in respect of whom a reference has been made to the Supreme Court under clause (1) until the President has passed orders on receipt of the report of the Supreme Court on such reference.
(3) Notwithstanding anything in clause (1), the President may by order remove from office the Chairman or any other member of a Public Service Commission if the Chairman or such other member, as the case may be,—

(b) engages during his term of office in any paid employment outside the duties of his office; or
(c) is, in the opinion of the President, unfit to continue in office by reason of infirmity of mind or
body.
(4) If the Chairman or any other member of a Public Service Commission is or becomes in any way concerned or interested in any contract or agreement made by or on behalf of the Government of India or the Government of a State or participates in any way in the profit thereof or in any benefit or emolument arising therefrom otherwise than as a member and in common with the other members of an incorporated company, he shall, for the purposes of clause (1), be deemed to be guilty of misbehaviour.

Summary
Draft Article 285A (Article 317 of Constitution of India 1950) was not included in the Draft Constitution 1948. It was introduced by the Drafting Committee Chairman on
22 August 1949
. It laid down the manner in which a member of a Public Service Commission may be suspended or removed. The President was empowered to remove a member of a Public Service Commission in two instances – (i) proof of misbehaviour and (ii) automatic disqualification. The grounds for automatic disqualification were (i) being declared insolvent, (ii) infirmity of mind or body or (ii) taking up any other employment during the period of membership with the Public Service Commission.
A Member
felt
that the phrase ‘shall only be removed’ should be replaced with ‘may be removed’. The Assembly did not
discuss
this suggestion.
Another Member
proposed
that the phrase ‘misbehaviour or of infirmity of mind or body’, be substituted with the words ‘misdemeanour or incapacity’ as the phrase was colloquial. The Assembly
rejected
this amendment without any debate.
The Draft Article was
adopted
on the same day.
