Summary
Draft Constitution 1948 (Article 81) was discussed on
19 May 1949
. It required the members of the Parliament to take an oath before assuming his/her office.
A member
moved
an amendment that would require the oath to be administered before ‘Speaker of the House of Representatives or Chairman of the Council of States’ instead of the President. He
argued
that the President should be kept out of a ‘purely internal concern of the House’. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee
argued
against this amendment. A candidate after winning an election did not automatically become a member of the Parliament. He/she must meet additional qualifications including taking the oath. Hence only after all the candidates took the oath, would they become members of the house and go on to elect the Speaker.
Therefore
it was necessary to have someone other than the Speaker to facilitate the oath ceremony.
The President of the Assembly
enquired
regarding the members who would join in the middle of a session after a bye-election. He wanted to know before whom would such members take the oath. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee
noted
that after a Speaker was elected by the house, the President would confer, by order, his/her authority to administer the oath to the Speaker.
The Chairman of the Drafting Committee
moved
another amendment. He sought to replace ‘declaration’ with ‘oath or affirmation’.
