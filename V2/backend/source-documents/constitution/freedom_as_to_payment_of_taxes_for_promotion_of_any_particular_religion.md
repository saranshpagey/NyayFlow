Summary
Draft Article 21 (Article 27) was debated on
7 December 1948
. It prohibited the State from imposing taxes to raise funds for the promotion or maintenance of any specific religion.
There was some confusion in the Assembly about the Article’s meaning. Some members
seemed
to have misinterpreted the Article to mean that religious property was not taxable. Operating under this false understanding, a member
argued
that religious property should be treated on par with other types of property and should be taxable. Another member intervened to clarify the true meaning of the Draft Article. He
pointed out
that in Indian history, kings often collected a special tax to support a particular religion; this use of public tax money had no place in secular India. Therefore, these amendments were all
rejected
.
The Draft Article was
adopted
without amendment on 7 December 1948.
Later, some cosmetic amendments were made to the Draft Article by the Drafting Committee.
