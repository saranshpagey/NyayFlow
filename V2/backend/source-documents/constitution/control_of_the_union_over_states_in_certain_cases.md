SUMMARY
Draft Articles 234 and 234A (Article 257) was debated on
13 June 1949
and
9 September 1949
. It gave the Union certain power over the states.
The Drafting Committee Chairman proposed the insertion a new
clause
and an
amendment
, respectively. The clause stated that the Centre had to compensate the states for any additional costs undertaken under its direction. This was added without any objection. The amendment (Article 234A) was about the railways. It gave the Centre the power to direct the state to increase policing in any railway that might require it. This was
disputed
by a member who asserted that the provision was not required since the Centre already had enough power. The Chairman
clarified
that it was needed since ‘police’ was not a Union subject, and that ‘Railway Police’ is a subject within the authority of the State. Additionally, he cleared that the railways were given focus since people gathered there in masses.
Draft Article 234 was initially adopted without debate on
13 June 1949
. Subsequently, the addition (234A) to the Draft Article was adopted on
9 September 1949
.
