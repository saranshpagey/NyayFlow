Summary
Draft Article 79A (Article 98) was debated on
30 July 1949
. It laid down the office of Secretariat of Parliament. It was not a part of the original
Draft Constitution, 1948
. Instead, it was introduced as an amendment by the Drafting Committee.
The Chairman of the Drafting Committee
noted
that the motivation to include this provision stemmed from a Conference organised by Speakers of various Provinces. Encoding this provision in the Constitution would
ensure
that the office of the Secretariat was not controlled by the Executive, instead, it would be appointed and regulated by the Parliament itself.
A member
believed
that this Draft Article would protect the independence of the office of the Secretariat. He invoked his experiences as a Mayor and highlighted how the Secretariats for the Mayors were under complete control of the Executive. This led to several issues including denial of granting sufficient resources for the functioning of his office. This Draft Article would tackle these problems at the Parliament level.
There was an
argument
made to lay down terms relating to appointment, promotions and conditions of service in this Draft Article itself. The member noted that such matters should not be left for the Parliament to decide. He went a step further and demanded ‘Federal Public Service Commission’ to be made in charge of the Secretariat, not the Parliament. This would ensure impartiality in appointing and running of the office.
The Assembly did not accept these proposals. It
adopted
the Draft Article on 30 July 1949.
