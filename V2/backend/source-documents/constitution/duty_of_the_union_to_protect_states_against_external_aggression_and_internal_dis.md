It shall be the duty of the Union to protect every State against external aggression and internal disturbance and to ensure that the Government of every State is carried on in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution.
VERSION 1
Article 355, Constitution of India 1950
It shall be the duty of the Union to protect every State against external aggression and internal disturbance and to ensure that the government of every State is carried on in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution.
SUMMARY
Draft Article 277A was absent in the
Draft Constitution 1948
. The Drafting Committee Chairman
introd
uced
this provision on
3 August 1949
.
The Draft Article placed an obligation on the Union to protect States against external aggression and internal disturbance and to ensure that States function according to the Constitution.
The Drafting Committee Chairman
introduced
this amendment to
clarify
the Centre’s intrusion into a State’s domain in an emergency would arise out of the Centre’s constitutional obligation and is not arbitrary or wanton.
A member
fe
lt
that ‘internal disturbance’ was vague and wanted to
replace
it with ‘internal insurrection or chaos’. A more specific term like ‘insurrection or chaos’ would prevent the Union to interfere in State’s affairs arbitrarily.
The member
pointed
that the Draft Article used the phrase external aggression
and
internal disturbance. He
suggested
replacing the ‘and’ with ‘or’ so that the Union could interfere in a State if either situation emerged.
One
defended
the Draft Article and went further to argue for such powers even in a non-emergency situation.
All the amendments to the Draft Article were
rejected
by the Assembly and the Draft Article was
adopted
as is on
4 August 1949
.
