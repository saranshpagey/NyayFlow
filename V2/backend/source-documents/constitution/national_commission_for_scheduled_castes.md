SUMMARY
Draft Article 299 was taken up for discussion on
26 August 1949
and
14 October 1949
. This Draft Article empowered the President and Governor to appoint a special officer for minorities at the Union and State level. These officers would deal with constitutional safeguards provided for minorities. A report would be prepared on the implementation of the safeguards and submitted to the President or Governor respectively. These reports would then be submitted before Parliament and State legislatures.
The Drafting Committee Chairman
proposed
to have only one minorities officer at the Union level. He
believed
that since minorities groups covered under the safeguards had been reduced, there was no need for a complex enforcement mechanism.
It was
urged
by some Members that the Draft Article be discussed at a later stage when there is clarity on which minorities are given protection in the Constitution. The President
felt
that this Draft Article covers all minorities and therefore is not subject to the Assembly’s decision on who are considered minorities. However, to prevent repetition of discussion on this issue, he
postponed
the debate on Draft Article 299.
Since the beneficiaries of protections under the Constitution had been finalised, Draft Article 299 was taken up for discussion again on 14 October 1949. This time, the Drafting Committee
pr
oposed
to replace the provision for appointing a special officer for Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities to analyse the implementation of the constitutional safeguards for the community. It also covered other backward classes that the President may include and Anglo-Indians.
Two Members were
concerned
that the Draft Article does not mention what action Parliament should take based on the report. They wanted an explicit provision to empower Parliament to take action based on the President’s submission. However, it was
clarified
that Parliament has the general power to take action based on submissions made before it.
A member
opposed
the inclusion of backward classes in the Draft Article. He
believed
it was a vague term and would impose difficulties on the President to identify such communities. The Assembly did not address this objection.
A Member from a minority committee
proposed
to revert to the provision as mentioned in the Draft Article – a special officer to be appointed at the Union and State level for implementing safeguards for minorities. A Member
responded
that having officers at different levels would be complicated and that it was agreed by the Assembly that special safeguards will be given only to SC/ST communities.
The Assembly
accepted
the Drafting Committee’s amendment and
rejected
the others.
Draft Article 299 (as amended) was
adopted
on
14 October 1949
.
Article 338 was
amended
in
2003
to set-up a national commission instead of a special officer for Scheduled Castes. In
2018
, Article 338 was
amended
again, to remove backward classes from its ambit.
