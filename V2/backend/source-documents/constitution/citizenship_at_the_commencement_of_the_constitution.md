Summary
Draft Article 5 (Article 5) laid down basic principles of citizenship. The Assembly discussed this Draft Article on
10
,
11
and
12 August 1949
.
Some members
sought
to include a residuary provision for citizenship based on religion. They argued that every Hindu or Sikh who is not a citizen of any other state, irrespective of their residence should be entitled for Indian citizenship. In rebuttal, one member
strongly urged
against hyphenating religion and citizenship. He argued that rules must be informed by justice and equity and not on extraneous conditions.
Another member was keen on the draft article
accommodating
dual citizenship. He added that this privilege must be extended to countries on the principle of reciprocity.
One member
believed
that this Draft Article made Indian citizenship cheap and easily available. In response, it was
pointed out
that the provisions of this Draft Article were stricter than the American law on citizenship.
Few members voluntarily withdrew their amendments, while other amendments which were put to vote were negatived. The Constituent Assembly
adopted
Draft Article 5 as introduced by the Drafting Committee on 12 August 1949.
