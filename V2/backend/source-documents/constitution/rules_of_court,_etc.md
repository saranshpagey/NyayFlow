Summary
Draft Article 121 (Article 145) was
debated
on 6th June 1949. It authorised the Supreme Court to make rules for its functioning.
One member
suggested
that clause (1) be amended to remove the requirement that court seek the approval of the President before adopting any rules. He
argued
that the rules pertained to the ‘internal functioning’ of the court, and hence the requirement amounted to executive interference with the functioning of the judiciary. This received the support of several members in the Assembly; it was
noted
that the High Court was not required to obtain the consent of the Governor when making similar rules. In response, another member
argued
that the Draft Article already provided that the rule-making power of the Supreme Court was subject to laws passed by Parliament, and hence the requirement of presidential approval was a ‘safety valve’ for the judiciary. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee
pointed
out that the requirement was analogous to existing provisions under the
Government of India Act, 1935
. He also clarified that the purpose was to ensure that rules did not impose an undue burden on the exchequer.
A member of the Drafting Committee
proposed
the insertion of the following as sub-clause (bb):
‘
rules as to the procedure for the review of any judgment pronounced or order passed by the Court including the time within which applications to the Court for such review are to be entered
;’
He
stated
that this amendment was a necessary corollary to the court’s power to make rules relating to its ability to review its own judgments.
Another member of the drafting committee
proposed
the substitution of Clause (2) as follows:
‘
(2) Subject to the provisions of the next succeeding clause, rules made under this article may fix the minimum number of judges who are to sit for any purpose, and may provide for the powers of single judges and Division Courts.
(2a) The minimum number of judges who are to sit for the purpose of deciding any case involving a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of this Constitution, or for the purpose of hearing any reference under article 119 of this Constitution shall be five:
Provided that where the Court hearing an appeal under article 111 of this Constitution consists of less than five judges and in the course of the hearing of the appeal the court is satisfied that the appeal involves a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of this Constitution the determination of which is necessary for the disposal of the appeal such court shall refer the question to a court constituted under this clause for opinion and shall on receipt of the opinion dispose of the appeal in conformity with such opinion.
‘
He
argued
that the proviso was necessary to ensure that the court’s time was not wasted by forcing a five judge bench to hear a matter for which a three-judge bench was sufficient. This amendment
received
the support of the Chairman of the Drafting Committee.
The Chairman of the Drafting Committee proposed two amendments:
firstly
, to mandate the court to only deliver judgments in open court; and
secondly
, to prevent the court from delivering any judgment without the concurrence of the majority.
With the
exception
of the amendment to remove the requirement of presidential approval, all other amendments were accepted by the Assembly. Draft Article 121 was
adopted
on 6th June 1949.
