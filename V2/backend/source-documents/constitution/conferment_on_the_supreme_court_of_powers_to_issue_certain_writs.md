Summary
Draft Article 115 (Article 139) was debated on
27th May 1949
. It conferred the power to issue writs on the Supreme Court.
The Chairman of the Drafting Committee proposed the deletion of the words ‘
which relates to the enforcement of fundamental rights
’ as they were superfluous.
A member
proposed
that the Draft Article be amended to bring its language in line with Draft Article 25 (
Article 19
), to read as follows:
‘
Parliament may by law confer on the Supreme Court power to issue directions, orders or writs, including writs in the nature of…
’
He
argued
that the existing language of the Draft Article was unnecessarily restrictive as it limited the writ power of the Supreme Court only to the writs named in the Draft Article. The acceptance of his amendment, he argued, ensured that Parliament was not restricted in its ability to expand the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to confer writs, directions, and orders as it saw fit.
Both proposed amendments were accepted without debate. The amended Draft Article was adopted by the Assembly on
27th May 1949
.
