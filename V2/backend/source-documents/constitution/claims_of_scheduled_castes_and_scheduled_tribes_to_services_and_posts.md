Article 335, Constitution of India 1950

SUMMARY
Draft Article 296 (Article 335 of Constitution of India 1950) was taken up for discussion on
26 August 1949
and
14 October 1949
. It states that the Union, States or any government entity will consider the representation of minorities as a factor when they make appointment to posts or services, subject to two conditions: first, that efficiency of administration is maintained and second, the provisions of Draft Article 297 are not violated.
The Assembly first took up this Draft Article on 26 August 1948 for debate. The Drafting Committee Chairman
wanted
to amend this Draft Article to state that only the claims of SC and ST communities should be considered in appointments. Two minority community Members
argued
that minorities were not consulted regarding this proposed change. They
wanted
to postpone the debate. The Assembly President
agreed
and
emphasized
that ‘
in matters relating to minorities we have always proceeded with their consent
’ and proceeded to set a later date for the debate.
On 14 October 1949 Ambedkar
moved
the same amendment formally. A Member
claimed
that proposal contradicted a previous decision of the Constituent Assembly and the Advisory Committee’s recommendations. He further added that no justification was provided for the change.
This Member
proposed
an amendment of his own that gave the State the power to extend the Draft Article’s benefits to any minority community that it felt was not adequately represented in government. Another Member
wanted
to bring ‘
other castes who are educationally and socially backward
‘ under the ambit of this provision.
A Member
proposed
to replace the Chairman’s amendment to state that only efficiency should be considered in appointments to public services. However, Parliament would be empowered to list special considerations that the President may take into account to ensure representation of the SC/ST communities.
The Assembly
rejected
the above proposals and
accep
ted
only the Drafting Committee Chairman’s amendment.
The Assembly
adopted
the amended Draft Article on
14 October 1949
.
Article 335 was amended in
2000
to permit laws that reduce the requirements or relax qualifications for members of SC/ST communities in appointments to public services.
