Summary
Draft Article 55 was discussed on
28
and
29 November 1948
, and
13th October 1949
. It regulated the election of the Vice President.
A member
moved
a proposal to synchronise the elections of the President and Vice-President. Another member
argued
that the state legislatures should be included in the electoral college. He
noted
that the manner of elections of the President and Vice-President must be similar and the state legislatures must not be ‘deprived’ of electing the Vice-President. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee defended the electoral composition. He pointed out that the composition of an electoral college for elections of the President and Vice-President was closely linked to their functions. The President was the head of the state whose powers extended to the centre and the states. Hence it was imperative to include state legislatures. However, the Vice-President’s role was largely restricted to the centre. It did not necessitate the state legislatures’ representation.
There was a
proposal
to delete ‘
the system of proportional representation
’ from clause 1. The mover of the amendment argued that proportional representation, as a form of election, cannot be implemented to fill up one seat. It ‘applies to a plurality of seats’. In support of this motion, another member invoked the English example. He highlighted a Royal Commission’s finding that explored all electoral systems. It found that in case of election to a single post, to secure majority ‘vote transferability’ should be employed. This system was termed as ‘alternative vote’. This should not be conflated with ‘proportional representation’. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee replied that he would consider this suggestion at a later state.
Another member was keen on listing disqualifications of the Vice-President. His
motion
included the following grounds: ‘
conviction for treason, or any offence against the safety, security or integrity of the State, or any violation of the Constitution, or has been elected and served more than once as President or Vice- President of the Union
’. In response, a member
pointed out
that
Draft Article 83
(
Article 102
, Constitution of India, 1950) laid down disqualifications of the members of the Parliament. Since, the Vice-President had to be qualified to be a member of the Parliament, insertion of additional grounds was unnecessary.
The Assembly adopted the Article on 29th December 1948 with minor amendments that were moved by the Drafting Committee. It was further
amended
on 13th October 1949.
