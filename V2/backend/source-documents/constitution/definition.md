Summary
Draft Article 28 was discussed on
19 November 1948
. It opened Part IV of the Draft Constitution titled ‘
Directive Principles of State Policy
’ and defined the meaning of ‘
State
’ in this context.
The debate began with an Assembly member
moving
an amendment to replace ‘
Directive
’ with ‘
Fundamental
’ in Part IV’s heading. The member
pointed out
that in the earlier committee stages, Part IV was titled as ‘
Fundamental Principles of Governance
’, and wanted to know why the heading was changed. It was
clarified
to the member the term ‘
Directive
’ was used to emphasise that principles contained in Part IV were directives; ‘
Fundamental
’ was consciously dropped to make Part IV distinct from Part III – Fundamental rights.
Another amendment
proposed
to replace ‘
the State
’ with ‘
State
’. This was
opposed
by the Chairman of the Drafting Committee, who argued that there were different senses in which the term ‘
State
’ was used in the Draft Constitution. The term ‘
the State
’ as used in Part III was the most appropriate for Part IV as well: panchayats, district and local boards (See
Article 12
), that came under ‘
the State
’ in Fundamental rights were the relevant institutions for the implementation of Directive Principles.
The Article was
adopted
on the same day without any amendments.
