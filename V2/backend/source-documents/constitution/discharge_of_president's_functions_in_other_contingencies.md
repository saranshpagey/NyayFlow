Summary
Draft Article 57 (Article 70) was debated on 29 December 1948. It gave the President residuary powers to discharge his/her functions.
There was no substantive debate around the Draft Article. A member did not want the President to have this residuary powers. Instead, he wanted the Parliament to regulate its exercise. He sought to make this provision applicable to the Vice-President as well. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee noted that the Vice-President’s role as the Chairman of the Council of States was specifically stated in the Constitution. The Constitution also provided for a Deputy Chairman in case of the Vice-President’s absence. Hence the amendment was not necessary.
The Assembly adopted the Draft Article without any amendments on 29th December 1948.
