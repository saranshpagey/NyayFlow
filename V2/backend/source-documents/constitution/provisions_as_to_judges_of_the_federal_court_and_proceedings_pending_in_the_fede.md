SUMMARY
Draft Article 308 was discussed in the Constituent Assembly on
10 October 1949
.
This transitional provision stated that the Judges of the Federal Court (established under the Government of India Act 1935) would automatically become the Judges of the Supreme Court of India after the new Constitution came into effect. It shifted all pending proceedings in the Federal Court to the Supreme Court. Further, the power of the Privy Council (the highest judicial body during the colonial regime) to consider and dispose of appeals and petitions was transferred to the Supreme Court of India.
The Drafting Committee Chairman
introduced
two amendments. The first gave the Privy Council time to dispose of certain types of cases involving appeals which might be pending before it, even after the Constitution came into force. The amendment aimed to reduce the hardship of the litigants. The
second
, did away with the Privy Councils that existed in the Princely States and brought the High Court in all these States under the Supreme Court of India.
One Member
felt
that to give the Privy Council more time to dispose off appeals was unnecessary as there would anyway be no pending Indian matters in the Privy Council. He
argued
that the provision was ‘
too wide and embraces imaginary cases which do not exist
’. Further, to give the Council such power after India would have become an independent republic with a functioning Constitution seemed rather strange to him. Another Member
added
that if the Council were to have such powers in the country after the Constitution came into force, it would be derogatory to Indian independence.
The Drafting Committee Chairman
saw
no substance in these oppositions. He
insisted
that the continued power of the Privy Council to dispose pending appeals was necessary. Further, he
assured
members that there was no reason to feel humiliated as the Council, after independence, would only be acting as an agent of the Constituent Assembly.
Draft Article 308, as amended by the Drafting Committee Chairman, was
adopted
as part of the Constitution on 10 October 1949.
