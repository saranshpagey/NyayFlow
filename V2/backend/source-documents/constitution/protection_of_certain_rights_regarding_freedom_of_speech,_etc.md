Summary
Draft Article 13 (Article 19, Constitution of India 1950) was debated on
1
and
2 December 1948
, and
16
and
17 October 1949
. It laid down the right to certain freedoms with certain restrictions.
The discussion primarily focused on the restrictions placed on the exercise of the freedoms set out in this Draft Article. Some members
felt
that no right can be absolute, and that there must exist limitations on the same in certain circumstances. These supporters of the restrictions placed on the freedoms
maintained
that such restrictions are necessary to ensure the unhampered functioning of the Constitution and the State, particularly in light of the sociopolitical situation at the time.
Other members were gravely concerned that the restrictions provided in this Draft Article greatly curtailed the extent of the freedoms enjoyed under it. A member
argued
that the restrictions were so wide that the situation would not be too different from what it was under colonial rule.
Multiple amendments were proposed to this Draft Article. Predictably, most of them were in relation to the scope of the restrictions. First, a member
proposed
an amendment introducing the term ‘
reasonable restrictions
’ into the Draft Article, which would allow the Courts to review legislation and strike down arbitrary restrictions. This amendment was
adopted
.
Second, a Drafting Committee member
advocated
that laws on sedition should not operate as a restriction to the freedom of speech and expression. He stated that the term sedition is ambiguous and has been interpreted widely by courts of law. This amendment too was
accepted
without significant debate.
Third, at a much later sitting of the Assembly, when the Draft Article had already been adopted, a Drafting Committee member
recommended
that laws on contempt of court be introduced as a restriction on freedom of speech and expression. He felt that freedom of speech should not enable an individual to disregard contempt of court laws. A member resented the further curtailment on the freedom of speech and expression,
opposing
this amendment on the grounds that judges may misuse the same. The amendment was however,
adopted
.
A number of other amendments were
rejected
by the Assembly.
The Draft Article was
adopted
with the initial amendments on 2 December 1948, with a further amendment
being made
on 17 October 1949.
