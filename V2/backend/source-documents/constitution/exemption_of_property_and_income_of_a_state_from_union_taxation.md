SUMMARY
Draft Article 266 (Article 289, Constitution of India 1950) was discussed in the Assembly on
9 September 1949
. This Draft Article regulates taxation of a State Government by the Union. It did not permit the Union to tax State Governments on lands or buildings and income accruing within the State. However, it allowed the Union to tax State Governments on its trade or business. Further, it also allowed taxation of rulers of princely states on their personal property and income.
The Chairman of the Drafting Committee
proposed
an amendment to replace the Draft Article and provide that the Union would not tax property and income of the State governments. However, Parliament by law could empower the Union to tax income from trade or business of the State governments excluding trade or business declared as incidental to ordinary functions of government by Parliament.
Many Members
proposed
amendments to curtail the power the Union to tax the State Governments. They suggested excluding (i) trade and business carried on within the State, (ii) trade and business carried on before the commencement of the Constitution and (iii) programmes of their development and expansion; the preparations for which are complete.
The Finance Minister
reassured
the Members that public utility undertakings would be outside the scope of taxation and there would not be any discrimination between the Union and the State in regard to the taxation of industrial undertakings. Based on these assurances, these amendments were subsequently
withdrawn
.
The Assembly adopted the Draft Article as amended by the Chairman of the Drafting Committee on
9 September 1949
.
