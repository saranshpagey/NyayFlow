Summary
The Constituent Assembly debated Draft Article 49 on
27 December 1948
. It puts down an oath or affirmation for the President to take before entering his/her office.
A member
wanted
to explicitly mention ‘God’ in the oath. He was
concerned
with the lack of invocation of ‘
grace and blessing of God
’ in the Constitution. The Indian religious and spiritual legacy has given special
prominence
to God: every religion including Hinduism, Christianity, Islam and Sikhism invoke God in religious texts and ceremonies. He
added
that the Constitution was sacred and must be offered to God. In opposition, a member
argued
that this amendment would ‘
be excluding those people who have no faith in God at all
’. He noted that this amendment would create an ‘
obligation on people that they should have faith in God
‘.
Another member
passed
a similar amendment. However, in his proposal ‘agnostics’ were given a choice to not invoke God and just ‘solemnly affirm’. This amendment, he
argued
, protected a person’s freedom of faith. Mention of ‘God’ in the oath does not
impinge
on the ‘secularity’ of the Indian State. Further, when a person has taken an oath, they do so in their personal capacity and not as the official head of the State. He also
drew
on the British and Irish examples to demonstrate how the invocation of God does not lead to communalism.
Generally opposing the use of ‘God’ in the oath, a member
argued
that it was unnecessary to invoke ‘God’ who is omnipresent. Instead, he urged that oath must be taken in the name of the people of India, as laid out in the Irish Constitution.
There was a proposal to delete the Draft Article. The mover
noted
that the Constitution was human-made and imperfect, the name of perfect God should not be dragged into the Constitution.
A member put
forth
a case for including promise to not promote one’s interest and family’s aggrandisement. He highlighted that the values of the Indian freedom struggle must not be ‘copy-book maxim’ but be extended to real life.
The Chairman of the Drafting Committee was in
support
of the inclusion of ‘God’. He believed this would not alter the ‘secular’ state. It was pointed out that the oath did not carry any legal obligations; a person swearing an oath is bound by its ‘purely moral’ obligations. The President must have the liberty to swear in God’s name or otherwise.
The proposal to include God was
accepted
. The Assembly
adopted
the Draft Article on 27 December 1948.
