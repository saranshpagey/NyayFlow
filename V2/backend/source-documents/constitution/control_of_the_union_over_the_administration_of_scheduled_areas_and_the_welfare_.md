SUMMARY
Draft Article 300 (Article 339, Constitution of India 1950) was taken up on
16 June, 1949
. It gives the President the power to appoint a Commission to report on the administration and welfare of scheduled areas and tribes.
The Drafting Committee Chairman
moved
an amendment to include Part III states of the first Schedule (Princely States) within the ambit of the Draft Article.
Some members
supported
the Article and argued that it was important to include it in the Constitution for the empowerment of Scheduled Tribes.
One
Member
however,
felt
that the Draft Article would not go far in imporving the conditions of Scheduled tribes. He stated that a mere appointment of a Commission wasn’t enough and felt that the Draft Article shouldn’t be added to the Constitution.
The Drafting Committee Chairman’s amendment was
accepted
and the Draft Article was
added
to the Constitution without any further discussion.
