Summary
Draft Article 97 (Article 117) was debated on
10 June 1949
. It laid out special procedural provisions relating to the passage of financial bills.
A member
proposed
that clause 3 of the Draft Article should be amended to prevent the government from spending any money in war-like operations outside the territory of India. This could be allowed only when the President sought authorization from the Parliament after providing his reasons in writing. He
contended
that this would not hinder the ability of the state to defend itself, instead would act as a check on the government’s unfettered spending on wars. In response, it was
argued
this amendment would limit the executive’s power in defending the nation’s frontiers and integrity.
Another member
proposed
the deletion of clause 3 of the Draft Article. He
argued
that this clause could be strictly interpreted to mean that no Bill could be moved in either house of the Parliament unless on the recommendation of the President, as every Bill would require some government expenditure. In response, a member
proposed
the amendment of clause 3 to clarify that it would only apply where funds were sought from the Consolidated Fund of India.
The aforementioned proposals were voted in negative. The Assembly
accepted
minor changes proposed by the Drafting Committee and
adopted
the Draft Article on 10 June 1949.
