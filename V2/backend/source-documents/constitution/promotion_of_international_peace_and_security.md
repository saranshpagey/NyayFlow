Summary
Draft Article 40, the closing provision of the Directive Principles of State Policy, was taken up for debate on
25 November 1948
. It directed the State to adopt certain principles in its dealings with the world at large, namely peace, security and respect for international law.
The debate began with an amendment
moved
by the Chairman of the Drafting Committee, that proposed to include a simpler version of the Draft Article.
A large section of the Assembly emphasised the importance of world peace. Members felt that not only should India play its role in effectuating world peace; one
claimed
that India was best placed to do so — peace, non-aggression and spirituality being key aspects of India history and culture. Another member
argued
that making vague statements was not enough, India should, through some formal mechanism, pledge that it will work towards world peace.
There was quite a bit of discussion around international law and its role in the world. Members viewed international law as playing a critical role in ensuring amicable relations between nations. A member even
expressed
the hope that at some point in the future, a world government would emerge where nations gave up some part of their sovereignty.
Members viewed the Draft Article as an expression of India’s intention to pursue an independent foreign policy. It was
argued
that now, unlike before, India would not be dragged into the quarrels of other countries and would not align with power blocs.
The Draft Article was
adopted
with a
few amendments
on the same day, that is 25 November 1948.
