Summary
Draft Article 106 (Article 127) was debated on 27 May 1949. It laid out the rules pertaining to the appointment of ad hoc judges to the Supreme Court of India.
A member
proposed
that clause (1) be amended to stipulate that a High Court judge may be appointed as an ad hoc judge only if they meet the criteria under Draft Article 103 (Article 124) required for the ordinary appointment of a Supreme Court judge.
Another member
proposed
an amendment to clause (1) which required the Chief Justice of India to obtain the consent of the President before requesting a judge to serve ad hoc on the Supreme Court. He
contended
that it was be improper to appoint a judge on an ad-hoc basis without any input from the Executive, particularly as the President ordinarily appointed judges.
The amendments were positively
received
by the Chairman of the Drafting Committee, and were accepted by the Assembly without debate. The amended Draft Article was
adopted
on 27 May 1949.
