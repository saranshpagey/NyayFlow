Article

The State shall take steps to organise village panchayats and endow them with such powers and authority as may be necessary to enable them to function as units of self-government.
Version 1
Article 31A, Draft Constitution of India 1948
The State shall take steps to organise village panchayats and endow them with such powers and authority as may be necessary to enable them to function as units of self-government.
Summary
Draft Article 31A (Article 40) was not part of the Draft Constitution of 1948. It was a new amendment
introduced
in the Assembly on
22 November 1948
, while deliberations over the Draft Constitution were underway. The amendment aimed to ‘
unequivocally
’ direct the State to realise a Panchayati Raj system in India.
The Assembly seemed to be in consensus over the inclusion of the Article in the Draft Constitution. Most members’ speeches focused on why the Article was important. While some
emphasised
that the Article was the culmination of M.K. Gandhi’s ideas on the role of villages, others
raised
the economic and even military benefits of organising ‘
village republics
’.
The amendment was
added
to the Draft Constitution with no opposition.
