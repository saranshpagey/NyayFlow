Summary
Draft Article 143 (Article 163) was debated on
1st June 1949
. It created a Council of Ministers to aid and advise the Governor.
A member
proposed
that clause (1) be amended so that the Council could aid and advise the Governor even in the exercise of his discretionary powers. He
argued
that this gave the Governor more authority than the President in relation to the Council’s advice. He further
contended
that it violated the principles of constitutional government to invest the Governor with wide discretionary powers. A member of the Drafting Committee
clarified
that the Governor would be bound to act on the advice of the Council except on those matters which explicitly came under his discretionary powers under Draft Article 188. He pointed out that the present Draft Article could be later revised if the Assembly decided to remove discretionary powers altogether during the debate on Draft Article 188.
A member
proposed
to an amendment to explicitly state that the Chief Minister, as the head of the Council, would be responsible to the Governor. He argued that the Constitution was based on the principle of the executive’s responsibility to the legislature. Since the Chief Minister would be heading the Council and adjudicating on matters of great importance, it was necessary for him to be ‘
directly responsible for any advice tendered to the Constitutional head of the State.
’ One member agreed with this,
expressing
concern that the Draft Article only required the Council to render advice to the Governor, and did not bind the latter to act on it. Another member disagreed, arguing that there may be many situations in which the advice of the Council may not be appropriate.
Both amendments were
negatived
by the Assembly. Draft Article 163 was
adopted
on 1st June 1949.
