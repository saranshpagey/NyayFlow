Summary
Draft Article 145 ( Article 165) was debated on
1st June 1949
. It created the position of Advocate-General in each state, and set out the conditions of service for the role.
One member
proposed
to insert the following after clause (2):
‘
(2a) In the performance of his duties the Advocate-General shall have the right of audience in all courts in the State of which he is attached and when appearing for such State, also in all other courts within the territory of India including the Supreme Court.
‘
He believed that it was
necessary
for the Advocate-General to have the right of audience in all courts in the territory of India. This was
analogous
to the powers of the Attorney-General of India under Draft Article 63 (
Article 76
), and the
Public Prosecutor
under the Code of Civil Procedure. He
argued
that if this amendment was not accepted, it could cause difficulties as the Advocate-General would have to obtain separate authorisation every time he was required to appear in the courts of another state. Another member supported this amendment,
contending
that it would also allow eminent jurists who are not enrolled in any High Court to be appointed as an Advocate-General. A member of the Drafting Committee
responded
that unlike the Attorney General, who was meant to represent the central government’s interests throughout the country, the Advocate General was supposed to only represent the state government within the state; therefore the amendment was unnecessary. This amendment was
rejected
by the Assembly.
The same member
proposed
another amendment to substitute clauses (3) and (4) with a provision for the Advocate-General to hold office at the pleasure of the Governor. He
argued
that the present Draft Article made the tenure of the Advocate-General subject to party politics, which made him vulnerable to executive interference. This amendment was
accepted
by the Chairman of the Drafting Committee and
adopted
by the Assembly.
The amended Draft Article was
adopted
on 1st June 1949
