Summary
Draft Article 101 (Article 122) was debated on
23 May 1949
. It barred any court from inquiring into parliamentary proceedings on grounds of procedural irregularities.
The proposals around this Draft Article revolved around language changes and suggestions to avoid future conflicting interpretations.
One member
sought
to add ‘in any court’ in clause (1). This would make it obvious that the provision prohibited ‘any court’ from inquiring into parliamentary proceedings. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee
responded
that this amendment was redundant, as the courts of India were the only appropriate forum in which such an inquiry could take place.
Another member
proposed
that the phrase ‘or other member’ in clause (2) be replaced by ‘or no member’. He
claimed
that the former was misleading as it implied that an officer was also a member of Parliament. In response, a member
contended
that the Speaker and Deputy Speaker were both members and officers, and hence the use of the phrase ‘or other member’ was accurate. This argument was further
supported
by the Chairman of the Drafting Committee.
The proposed amendments were negatived, and the Draft Article was
accepted
by the Assembly. It was
adopted
on 23 May 1949.
