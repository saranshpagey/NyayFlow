Summary
Draft Article 99 (Article 120) was debated on
17 September 1949
. It prescribed Hindi and English as the languages to be used in the Parliament, with exceptions for members who could not express themselves adequately in either language.
The Chairman of the Drafting Committee
moved
an Amendment to substantially modify the Draft Article. The debates in the Assembly were based on this Amendment.
A member
proposed
that clause (1) be amended to include Bengali or any other regional language as an alternative to Hindi and English. He argued that
members
of Parliament might be prohibited from speaking in their mother tongue since the proviso to clause (1) gave the Speaker of the House the discretion to permit the use of regional languages. The member later
withdrew
his amendment from consideration.
The Assembly
accepted
the Drafting Committee’s amendment and
adopted
the Draft Article on 17 September 1949.
