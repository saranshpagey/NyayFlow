(1A) While an order made under clause (1) mentioning any of the rights conferred by Part III (except articles 20 and 21) is in operation, nothing in that Part conferring those rights shall restrict the power of the State as defined in the said Part to make any law or to take any executive action which the State would but for the provisions contained in that Part be competent to make or to take, but any law so made shall, to the extent of the incompetency, cease to have effect as soon as the order aforesaid ceases to operate, except as respects things done or omitted to be done before the law so ceases to have effect:
Provided that where a Proclamation of Emergency is in operation only in any part of the territory of India, any such law may be made, or any such executive action may be taken, under this article in relation to or in any State or Union territory in which or in any part of which the Proclamation of Emergency is not in operation, if and in so far as the security of India or any part of the territory thereof is threatened by activities in or in relation to the part of the territory of India in which the Proclamation of Emergency is in operation.
(1B) Nothing in clause (1A) shall apply—
(a) to any law which does not contain a recital to the effect that such law is in relation to the Proclamation of Emergency in operation when it is made; or
(b) to any executive action taken otherwise than under a law containing such a recital.
(2) An order made as aforesaid may extend to the whole or any part of the territory of India:
Provided that where a Proclamation of Emergency is in operation only in a part of the territory of India, any such order shall not extend to any other part of the territory of India unless the President, being satisfied that the security of India or any part of the territory thereof is threatened by activities in or in relation to the part of the territory of India in which the Proclamation of Emergency is in operation, considers such extension to be necessary.
(3) Every order made under clause (1) shall, as soon as may be after it is made, be laid before each House of Parliament.

SUMMARY
Draft Article 280 (Article 359 of the Constitution of India, 1950) was discussed in the Constituent Assembly on
4
and
20 August 1949
. Under
Draft Article 25
, Indians could approach courts for a remedy when their fundamental rights were violated. Draft Article 280 gave the President the power to suspend this provision during an emergency for a period of six months.
During the debate the Drafting Committee Chairman
introduced
an amendment that limited the suspension of fundamental rights to only a part of the country and required parliamentary approval of the President’s order.
The amendment did not have any effect on the general tenor of the debate which was hostile to the Draft Article. Members
feared
that it promoted the
abuse of power
by the executive,
undermined
protections for citizens against arbitrary state action and
did not
contain sufficient safeguards against its
misuse
. One Member was particularly
concerned
that the Draft Article took away Habeas Corpus — a writ available even during colonial rule; He
proposed
an amendment that protected the writ. A group of members
reluctantly
said
that if such a power must exist, then it should be exercised by parliament and not the executive.
A small set of members came in support of the Draft Article and
argue
d
that these powers were necessary to ensure that the State could maintain people’s freedom. A Member of the Drafting Committee
in
v
oked
a saying ‘
war cannot be fought on principles of the Magna Carta
’. He reminded the house that these powers were critical to preserve the existence of the State. After all, it was the State which guaranteed freedom in the first place.
Despite strong opposition, the Drafting Committee Chairman remained unconvinced and defended the Draft Article. He
argued
that there was a universal agreement that fundamental rights are not absolute, there was only disagreement regarding ways of curtailing them. He
said
that there were enough safeguards within the Article to ensure that the President did not misuse his/her power. The President could not issue an order in his/her personal capacity – he would be guided by the executive which in turn was drawn from and accountable to Parliament.
On 20 August 1949, Draft Article 280 as
amende
d
by the Drafting Committee Chairman was
adopted
as part of the constitution and the rest of the amendments were
rejected
.
