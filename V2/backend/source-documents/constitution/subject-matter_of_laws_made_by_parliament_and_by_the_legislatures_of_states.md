SUMMARY
Draft Article 217 (Article 246, Constitution of India, 1950) was debated on
13 June 1949
. It chalked out the federal structure of India by defining the scope of the Union Parliament’s and the State Legislatures’ power to make laws. The Union Parliament could make laws on subjects mentioned in the Union List, while the State Legislatures could make laws on subjects mentioned in the State List. Both the Union Parliament and the State legislature were given the joint power to make laws on subjects mentioned in the Concurrent List. Further, the Union Parliament was given the power to laws on subjects that were not mentioned in any of the three lists.
The debate was a rather short one: only one member made a substantive intervention. This member was not happy with how the Draft Article’s clauses were ordered. He
proposed
an amendment to swap the positions of Clauses 2 and 3. The resulting form of the Draft Article was more logical, he
claimed
. Further, the member wanted the Draft Article to say that the Union Parliament’s and the State Legislatures’ power to legislate would extend to matters that were essential for the effective exercise of matters already assigned to them in the three lists.  There were no substantive responses to these interventions and the Assembly rejected related amendments.
The Assembly then
adopted
the Draft Article on 13 June 1949 with some minor amendments.
