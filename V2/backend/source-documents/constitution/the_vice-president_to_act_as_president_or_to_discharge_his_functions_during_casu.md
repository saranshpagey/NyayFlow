Summary
Draft Article 54 was debated on
28 December 1948
. In case of vacancy of the President’s office, this article gave the Vice-President the President’s powers and obligations until the vacancy was filled.
The Chairman of the Drafting Committee
moved
an amendment to ensure that the Vice-President upon assuming the President’s office was entitled to ‘
privileges, emoluments, and allowances
‘ as decided by the Parliament. A member
argued
that the benefits that a Vice-President assuming President’s office enjoyed must be the same as that of the President’s. There was no need to discriminate the temporary President. There was a
proposal
to include ‘duties and liabilities’ to the Chairman’s amendment. It was argued that, while the amendment took care of the temporary President’s benefits, it did not include ‘duties and liabilities’ of the President. This would make it hard to impeach the temporary President if he/she violated the Constitution.
The Chairman of the Drafting Committee responded to these concerns. First, he
noted
that the Parliament should be given the prerogative to fix deferential benefits as this was a temporary position for a short time. He clarified that if there was no separate provision covering the temporary President’s benefits, he/she would be entitled to the President’s benefits. Second, he
asserted
that the temporary President would have the same obligations as that of the President. The impeachment provisions of the President would apply to the temporary President as well. It was unnecessary and superfluous to spell it in the Constitution.
The Assembly
adopted
the Draft Article with the Drafting Committee’s amendment.
