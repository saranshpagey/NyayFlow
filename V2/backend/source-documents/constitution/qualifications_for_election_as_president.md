Summary
The Constituent Assembly debated Draft Article 47 on
27 December 1948
and
13 October 1949
. The Draft Article lays down the required qualifications for an individual to be elected as the President of India.
A member
wanted
to ensure that a Minister who wanted to run for the President’s office first resigned from his current ministerial office. This, he
reasoned
, would avoid the misuse of the Minister’s office and staff for Presidential campaign. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee
highlighted
that this amendment would ‘
create complete administrative chaos
’. If Ministers were to resign, then all administrative responsibilities would come to a halt. It would not be feasible to delegate this role to bureaucrats or temporary Ministers. He further
noted
that the Election Commission, a constitutional body, would ensure fair elections and prevent any Minister from exercising undue influence.
There was an
amendment
which required President-elect to declare all ‘right, title, share, property and interest’ in any government-aided or supported enterprise, business or trade. Such assets were to be bought by the government. The amendment mover
invoked
German President Hindenberg’s involvement with the Prussian landlords which strengthened the Nazi government and strongly
urged
‘
that President should be free from any entanglements
’. Some members
opposed
this proposal and argued that it would infringe the right to hold private property which was a recognised fundamental right. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee
observed
that the proposal was rather novel and unprecedented: he illustrated how even the American Constitution, which adopted a Presidential form of government, did not have a similar provision. Moreover, this amendment was unnecessary as the Indian Constitution viewed the position of the President as ‘a nominal figurehead’. If the Assembly were to adopt this, there would be a
dearth
of Presidential candidates.
All substantive amendments were rejected. On 27 December 1948, the Draft Article was
adopted
with a minor amendment. The Drafting Committee successfully
moved
another minor amendment on
13 October 1949
.
