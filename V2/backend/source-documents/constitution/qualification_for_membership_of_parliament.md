Summary
This article was not a part of the initial
Draft Constitution, 1948
. It was
introduced
by the Chairman of the Drafting Committee as an amendment on
18 May 1949
. It laid down qualifications for membership of the Parliament.
The Chairman of the Drafting Committee
clarified
the purpose of this provision. He noted that while any voter qualified to stand for elections, he/she must meet certain ‘higher’ qualifications. A Parliamentarian should have experience and knowledge to discharge his/her responsibilities effectively. Encoding these additional qualifications will ensure better candidates at the Parliament.
A significant
proposal
was to reduce the age limit from 35 to 30 for members to the House of People. The mover of this amendment
argued
that ‘wisdom does not depend on age’. With education younger citizens had more civic awareness. Moreover, she pointed out how Jawaharlal Nehru was appointed as the President of Congress at a young age.
On 18 May 1949, the Assembly
adopted
the Draft Article with the
amendment
to reduce the age limit.
