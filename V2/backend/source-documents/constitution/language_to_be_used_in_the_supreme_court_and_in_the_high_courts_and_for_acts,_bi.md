Summary
Draft Article 301F was absent in the
Draft Constitution 1948
. A Drafting Committee Member
introduced
this provision as part of series of Articles on the official language of the Union and States on
12 September 1949
. It stated that the Supreme Court and High Courts would use English in all their proceedings. Further, all laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, orders and bye-laws would be in English.
A Member
proposed
to impose a time limit of 15 years for the use of English by Courts and laws mentioned in the Draft Article.

to empower the State to opt to use Hindi or any other language for proceedings of the High Court in the concerned State. However, judgements, decrees and orders would be in English. Further, laws and rules
passed
in the State in another language would be accompanied by an English translation certified by the Governor.
