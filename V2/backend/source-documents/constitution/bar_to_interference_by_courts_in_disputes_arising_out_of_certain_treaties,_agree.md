Summary
Draft Article 302-AA (Article 363 of the Constitution of India, 1950) was absent in the Draft Constitution of India 1948. It was introduced by the Drafting Committee Member in the Assembly on
16 October 1949
. The Draft Article barred the Courts from deciding cases that involved disputes regarding treaties, agreements or engagements between the Indian governments and the Princely States.
The Member who
introduced
the amendment
argued
that allowing the Courts to dispute such matters could upset arrangements that were designed to facilitate the Princely States to join the Indian Union.
There was no debate or discussion around this Draft Article and it was
accepted
as is on the same day.
