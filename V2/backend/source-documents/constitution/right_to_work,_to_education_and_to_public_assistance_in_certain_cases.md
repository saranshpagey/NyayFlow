Summary
Draft Article 32 (Article 41) was debated on
23 November 1948
. It directed the State to make provisions for adequate employment and educational opportunities, and social assistance for certain vulnerable groups.
One member
moved
an amendment to include ‘
medical relief
’ among the other social amenities. He also urged the rephrasing of ‘
undeserved want
’ to ‘
deserving relief
’. Another member
pointed out
that the right to medical relief is already provided for under Draft Article 38 (
Article 47
). It would be unnecessary to repeat it in this Draft Article.
The Assembly
adopted
this article on 23 November 1948 without amendments.
