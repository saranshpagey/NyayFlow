Summary
Draft Article 80 (Article 100) was debated on
19 May 1949
. It regulated the business of the Parliament concerning voting, quorum and vacancies.
A member
moved
a few amendments to edit grammar and language of the Draft Article. In clause 1, he sought to delete ‘other than the Chairman or Speaker or person acting as such’. Before ‘The Chairman’, he proposed to add ‘Provided that’. He
believed
that the Draft Article must be relieved from ‘needless verbiage’.
Another member generally
commented
that he was against the principle of conducting joint sittings of the Parliament. He hoped that the Assembly would drop it from the Draft Article.
The above-mentioned proposals were
voted out
. The Assembly
adopted
the Draft Article on 19 May 1949.
