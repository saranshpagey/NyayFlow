SUMMARY
The Draft Sixth Schedule (Sixth Schedule of Constitution of India 1950) was discussed in the Constituent Assembly on 5, 6 and 7 September 1949. It dealt with the administration of the tribal areas in the then State of Assam.
The proceedings began with the Drafting Committee Chairman introducing a few changes to the Draft Schedule. One member highlighted that Assam had a huge problem of political instability, mostly owing to its shared borders with 6 other countries and internal ethnic diversity. Hence, he thought it would be best to make it a Centrally administered Area. The Chairman dismissed this proposal and pointed out that it would be a very difficult task to split the governance of the State between the Governor and the Centre. He also assured the members that in the case of the border regions of Assam, the Schedule had ample safeguards to allow for Centre to intervene if needed.
A few members vehemently opposed the creation of District and Regional Councils within Assam that would allow the tribals some level of autonomy in governance. They felt that this would perpetually keep the tribals isolated. One member claimed that these councils would further intensify separatist tendencies and would be a threat to the existence of a stable government. Another member was categorical in his position that if the responsibilities of administration were given to the tribal population it would lead to, ‘chaos, anarchy and disorder throughout the length and breadth of this country’.
A member went into the background in which the Assembly’s sub-committee on tribals formulated the Draft Schedule and the particular conditions of the Hill tribes before independence to convince these Members of the need for such autonomous councils. He informed them that many of the Hill Tribes were already invested with ideas of a separate province and independent rule during the British regime and the best way to integrate them for the purpose of governing these areas was through some sort of self-governance. A few members came to his support and expressed their deep disappointment in how the rest of the Assembly members perceived the tribal population. One member chided them for thinking that the tribals would attack Assam and that the culture of the tribes was somehow subservient to other cultures. The Drafting Committee Chairman clarified that the laws made by the Parliament or State Assembly were applicable to all the autonomous councils unless the Governor ruled otherwise. He added that tribal representation would also be ensured in both these Legislatures—meaning that the tribal people would not be isolated and would very much be part of the rest of Assam and India.
The sixth schedule invited intense debate within the Assembly and the discussions went on for 3 days. Finally, on 7 September 1949 the Schedule as amended by the Drafting Committee Chairman was adopted as part of the Constitution.
