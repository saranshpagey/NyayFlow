Summary
Draft Article 169 (Article 194) was debated on
3 June
and
16 October 1949
. It provided certain privileges and immunities to members of the State Legislature.
A member
wanted
to amend the Draft Article to extend the privileges and immunities to individuals who participate in committees set up by either House of the State Legislature so that they may to act freely and without reservation while performing their duties. This amendment was
adopted
without debate.
Another member
expressed
concern about clause (3), which defined the immunities as analogous to those available to members of the House of Commons in the United Kingdom. He
pointed
out that the UK had an unwritten Constitution, and therefore the immunities were ‘nowhere collected in a systematic form’, making it difficult for Members to understand their exact scope. He proposed the creation of a Schedule defining these immunities and privileges. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee
argued
that defining all available immunities and privileges would be too lengthy to include in the Constitution.
The amended Draft Article was
adopted
on 3 June 1949.
Subsequently, a member of the Drafting Committee
proposed
to substitute clause (3) with the following:
‘
In other respects, privileges, immunities and powers of a House of the Legislature of a State and of the members and the committees of a House of such Legislature shall be such as may from time to time be defined by the Legislature by law, and until so defined, shall be those of the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom and of its members and committees at the commencement of this Constitution.
‘
He
stated
that a similar amendment had been accepted to Draft Article 85 (Article 105) on the immunities and privileges for Members of Parliament.
The amendment was
accepted
without debate on 16 October 1949.
