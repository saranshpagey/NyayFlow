Summary
Draft Article 285B (Article 318 of Constitution of India 1950) was absent in the Draft Constitution 1948. The Drafting Committee Chairman introduced this Draft Article on
22 August 1949
.
The Draft Article empowered the President to regulate the number of members of the Union and joint Service Commissions. This included the President’s power to determine the conditions of service for such members. The Governor would have the same powers over the members of a State Commission.
A member
proposed
that the President or the Governor should make provisions after consulting the Service Commission Chairman.
Another member
proposed
that the appointment of the members should be made by the Service Commission Chairman. He also specified how many members should be appointed and empowered the Commission to determine the conditions of service of the members instead of the President or Governor.
A third member also
moved
multiple amendments to the Draft Article – one of which was to replace ‘President’ and ‘Governor’ in the Draft Article to ‘Parliament or State Legislatures’.
All the amendments to the Draft Article were either
withdrawn or rejected
by the Assembly. The Draft Article was
adopted
without any amendment, on the same day.
