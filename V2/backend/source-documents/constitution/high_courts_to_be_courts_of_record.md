Summary
Draft Article 192 (Article 215) was debated on
6 June 1949
. It made every High Court a court of record.
The Chairman of the Drafting Committee
proposed
to wholly replace the Draft Article with the following:
‘High Courts to be courts of Record: Every High Court shall be a court of record and shall have all the powers of such a court including the power to punish for contempt of itself.’
The amendment also split the Draft Article into two, moving the provision relating to the constitution of the High Courts to Draft Article 192A (Article 216). It was
adopted
without any debate.
The amended Draft Article was
adopted
on 6 June 1949.
