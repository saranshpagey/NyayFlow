Summary
Draft Article 153 (Article 174) was debated on
2nd June 1949
. It laid down the rules relating to the sessions of State Legislatures.
One member
proposed
an amendment to clause (2)(c) allowing the Governor to dissolve the Legislative Assembly only if he ‘
is satisfied that administration is failing and the ministry has become unstable
‘. He
contended
that if the Constitution did not enumerate the circumstances under which a House could be dissolved, there was a possibility that the Governor could dissolve it for political reasons. This was
rejected
by the Assembly with little debate.
The Chairman of the Drafting Committee
moved
an amendment to delete clause (3) altogether, as it was ‘
inconsistent
with the scheme for a Constitutional Governor
’. This was
accepted
by the Assembly.
The
amended
Draft Article was adopted on 2nd June 1949.
