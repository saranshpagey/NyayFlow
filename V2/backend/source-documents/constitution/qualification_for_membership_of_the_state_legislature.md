Summary
Draft Article 152 (Article 173) was debated on
2nd June 1949
. It set out the qualifications to become a member of a State Legislature.
The Chairman of the Drafting Committee
moved
an amendment to wholly replace the Draft Article so that the criteria for qualification was (1) citizenship of India; (2) at least 25 and 35 years of age for the Assembly and Council respectively; and (3) as prescribed by any law made by the State Legislature. This was
accepted
with one
amendment
. The subsequent debates in the Assembly were based on this amendment.
One member
wanted
to reduce the minimum age to become a member of a Legislative Council, from thirty-five to thirty. to conform with the age requirement for members of the Upper House in the Parliament. This was
accepted
by the Assembly.
Another member
moved
an amendment to further expand the list of qualifications to require candidates to be literate, and qualified to vote in the constituency from they seek election. He
argued
that illiteracy and ignorance were related, and so it would be dangerous for illiterate candidates to be elected to the Legislature. This was
rejected
by the Assembly.
The amended Draft Article was
adopted
by the Assembly on 2nd June 1949.
