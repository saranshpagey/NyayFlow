Summary
Draft Article 14 (Article 20) was debated on
2
,
3
and
6 December 1948
. It offered certain protections relating to conviction for criminal offences.
One member
proposed
to replace the word ‘
law
’ with the phrase ‘
laws in force
’. He reasoned that the meaning of the phrase ‘
laws in force
’, as decided by the explanation to Draft Article 302 (Article 372) meant that it was more appropriate. The Assembly
accepted
this amendment.
A member of the Drafting Committee
proposed
to amend the Draft Article to expand its scope to the prosecution of individuals, rather than just punishment. He
argued
that if, for instance, a government official was subject to disciplinary proceedings for an act, they should not be prosecuted by the Court for the same offence and vice versa. This amendment was also
adopted
.
Another member
wanted
to include a new clause which protected individuals against ‘
unreasonable searches and seizures
’,
similar to provisions
in the American, Irish, and German Constitutions. Although several members supported this amendment, it was
rejected
by the Assembly.
Other amendments were negatived. The amended Draft Article was
adopted
on 6 December 1948.
