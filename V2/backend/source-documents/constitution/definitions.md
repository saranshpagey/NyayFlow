Summary
Draft Article 7 (Article 12) was debated on
25 November 1948
. It was a gateway provision for Part III on Fundamental Rights, and defined the term ‘
State
’ used throughout the Part.
Members of the Assembly were concerned that the wording of the Article was too vague and some moved amendments. One member
took issue
with the term ‘
other authorities
’ which would in effect bring in almost every government agency or officer under the ambit ‘
State
’. Another
argued
that it was inappropriate to district boards and municipalities as the ‘
State
’. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee
clarified
that ‘
other authorities
’ would refer to those that had ‘
the power to make laws or the power to have discretion vested in it
’. He further stated that it would be cumbersome to list the various institutions upon whom Part III was binding, so the term ‘
State
’ was useful in this regard.
The Assembly
adopted
the Article with just one minor
amendment
on 25 November 1948.
