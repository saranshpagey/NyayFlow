SUMMARY
Draft Article 229 (Article 252, Constitution of India 1950) was debated on
13 June 1949
. It permitted Parliament to make laws on a subject matter that it does not have the power to make laws on, if one or more State Legislatures passed a resolution to that effect.
One member
suggested
that the Draft Article be amended to allow for the Union Parliament and the State Legislature to repeal or amend the laws made under this Draft Article. In response, another member
clarified
the Draft Article as it stood allowed for this. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee himself
moved
another amendment which proposed that Parliament could exercise power under the Draft Article only if two or more (rather than one or more) States jointly passed a resolution to that effect. This amendment was
accepted
.
Draft Article 229 was adopted on
13th June 1949
.
