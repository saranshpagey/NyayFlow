Summary
Draft Article 193 (Article 217) was debated on
6
and
7 June 1949
. It laid down the procedure for appointment and conditions of service for judges of the High Court.
The assembly took issue with clause (1), with one member
suggesting
that the Governor should only be consulted, while the Chief Justice of the High Court should issue a ‘recommendation’. Another
argued
that Governor did not need to be consulted at all, while a third
proposed
that the Draft Article should be reworded to reflect
Draft Article 103 (Article 124)
on the appointment of Supreme Court judges. All these amendments were
negatived
, with one member
arguing
that it was not necessary to mirror all provisions on the Supreme Court.
A member
suggested
that the State Legislature should play a more important role in the removal of a Judge of the High Court of that State, arguing that the current Draft Article gave too much power to the President and the Parliament. This amendment was negatived.
One member
suggested
that age of retirement should be 63, while another
believed
that this should not be fixed by the Constitution, and instead it was best to rely on the existing custom of judges retiring at 60. A third member also
wanted
to remove age limits on service, arguing that it should be left to the wisdom of individual judges to decide when they are unable to continue their service. While the former amendments were
rejected
, the latter was
accepted
by the assembly.
Ultimately, the Assembly accepted a number of smaller amendments to the Draft Article, while others were negatived. The amended Draft Article was
adopted
on 7 June 1949.
