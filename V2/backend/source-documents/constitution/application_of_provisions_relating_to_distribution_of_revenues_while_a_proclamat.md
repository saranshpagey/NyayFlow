Summary
Draft Article 277 was discussed in the Assembly on
19
and
20
August 1949. It addressed the consequences of emergency on financial resources of the Union and States. The Draft Article empowered the President to make changes to the constitutional provisions on distribution of finances between the Union and states during an emergency. This order was time bound – it would expire by the end of financial year in which the emergency ended.
The Drafting Committee Chairman
introduced
another clause to this Draft Article – both houses of Parliament must approve the Presidential order. The Chairman
felt
that the power to alter financial arrangements between the Union and States cannot be left to the discretion of the President. He wanted Parliament to have a say in such important issues.
A Member
opposed
this amendment as he felt it didn’t change the existing power of Parliament. The Parliament had an inherent right to consider any matter of its choice. Further, he thought the powers given to the President under this provision were very wide. He
believed
that giving wide powers would adversely affect the financial obligations of the States. To restrict such power, he
proposed
to only permit the President to make changes to the transfer of income tax revenue to States.
Another Member
supported
curtailing the powers of the President under this Draft Article. The Draft Article would
affect
the budgets and planned expenditure of States causing undue financial hardship. He
suggested
that instead of passing a separate order, the changes to the financial provisions in the Constitution should be listed in the proclamation of emergency. This could be deliberated on by Parliament when approving the proclamation.
A Member
highlighted
that this power could be misused if the party in power at the Union and State levels are different. A few Members
requested
for the Draft Article to be reconsidered and discussed on a later date.
A Drafting Committee Member clarified that this power had been given only during an emergency. It would not completely change the fiscal structure, only a
few
necessary changes would be made. Nonetheless, Parliament
could
alter the financial arrangements even during normal circumstances.
The Drafting Committee Chairman
responded
to the opposition stating that the President would act reasonably and would not unduly alter the financial arrangements between the Union and States. He
emphasized
that the power of the President should not be curtailed and the Draft Article should be flexible to accommodate the prevailing circumstances.
The Assembly
accepted
the Chairman’s amendment and rejected the others.
The Draft Article was
adopted
with the amendment on 20 August 1949.
