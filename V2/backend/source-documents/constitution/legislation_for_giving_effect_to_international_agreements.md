SUMMARY
Draft Article 230 (Article 253) was discussed in the Constituent Assembly on
13 June 1949
and
14 October 1949
. The Draft Article gave the Union Parliament the exclusive power to make laws for any part of India’s territory in order to implement any treaty, agreement or convention involving one or more countries.
On 13 June 1949, the Assembly President
moved
an amendment to replace the words ‘
for any State or part thereof
‘ with
‘for the whole or any part of the territory of India
‘; This amendment was
adopted
without any debate on this day. Then on 14 October 1949, a member
proposed
that the following words be added at the end of the Draft Article ‘
or any decision made at any international conference
, association or other body.’ This amendment too was
adopted
without any debate.
