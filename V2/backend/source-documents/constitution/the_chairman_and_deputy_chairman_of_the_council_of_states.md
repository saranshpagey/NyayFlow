Summary
Draft Article 73 (Article 89) was debated on
19 May 1949
. It established the offices of Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Council of States.
A member
proposed
an amendment to clause two to substitute ‘another member’ to ‘a member’: this would allow the re-election of the outgoing Deputy Chairman.
In opposition, a member
pointed out
that if the Deputy Chairman was removed or voluntarily resigned from the office, it would not be appropriate to re-elect him/her. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee was not in favour of this proposal and
found
it ‘absurd’. The purpose of this Draft Article was to regulate the election of the Deputy Chairman, not his/her re-election. Draft Article 74 (
Article 90
) dealt with the vacancy of the Deputy Chairman’s office; Draft Article 73 would become operational upon such vacancy. And this does not bar re-election of a member who ceased to become a member due to lapse of time.
The Constituent Assembly
adopted
Draft Article without amendments on 19 May 1949.
