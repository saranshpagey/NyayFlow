The levy of different rates in different States is likely to lead to a discrimination in favour of goods imported from foreign countries which would be detrimental to the interest of Indian manufacturers as was pointed out by the Drugs Enquiry Committee in their report in 1931.

SUMMARY
The Draft Seventh Schedule (Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India 1950) was discussed in the Constituent Assembly on 29, 30 and 31 August 1949; 1, 2, 3 and 9 September, 1949; and 13 and 17 October 1949. Draft Article 217 conferred on Parliament and State Legislature, the power to make laws on matters listed out in the Draft Seventh Schedule. The schedule in turn provides three detailed lists – Union List, State List and Concurrent List – demarcating the matters on which Parliament and State Legislature have the sole and shared responsibility of making laws.
The Assembly took up for discussion each entry in the three lists against which amendments were moved. For instance, one item in the Union List that raised concerns of the Assembly members was the Union’s legislative control over any educational Institution that Parliament declared to be an institution of national importance. A few members were afraid this was an unnecessary expansion of the Centre’s jurisdiction as this meant that any educational institution could be brought under the Centre’s control in the future. Also, taking away more responsibilities of the State could lead to a weaker State and a sense of grievance against the Centre. Citing the State government’s incompetence and economically weak status, a few members wanted education entirely to be placed in the Union List and all Universities to be under Central control. One member reasoned that Centralisation would also mean better coordination between these institutions and greater national unity in a way.
A member moved an amendment to now place a ban on cattle-slaughter under the State List. Some members felt the Drafting Committee was being timid by not agreeing to explicitly state a ban on cow-slaughter within the Schedule. A Drafting Committee member countered that the function of this schedule was to only distribute legislative powers between the Union and the State and not to dictate the policy of the government. Hence, the Committee saw it more appropriate to limit such an entry within the Directive Principles of State Policy and not introduce it within this Schedule. He also reassured the Assembly members that the ban on cow-slaughter would be achieved even without an explicit provision in the Seventh Schedule. A member also pushed for this provision to be shifted to the Concurrent List, giving both the State and the Union legislative authority over this matter as the improvement and protection of cattle stock required the knowledge and funds of the Centre too. The finalized entry adopted by the Assembly made changes to include protection and did not include cow-slaughter.
The question of legislative control over taxation brought up a few points of conflict within the Assembly. While insisting that the duty to be paid on agricultural land must also be included in the Union List, one member took an inflexible position that States should have no financial autonomy as this would only further inequality between people and stall the country’s development. A member took a similar position on the Centre collecting agricultural duties citing the need for uniformity in taxation. The Drafting Committee member’s move to include duty on the excise of non-narcotic drugs within the Union List brought out scathing criticism from one member. He chided the Committee members that if they were going to rob the States from, ‘
powers, political, financial and others, it would be better for us to say here and now that Provincial (State) Autonomy must go and there must be Unitary Government
’.
One member introduced a new entry – 88-A – to the Union List that dealt with taxation on the sale or purchase of newspapers. Few members came out in strong opposition to the move. A member argued that it violated the Fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression and asked the Drafting Committee to reconsider the entry. A member opposing this position claimed that if one were to extend the meaning of freedom of speech and expression to this extent it would lead to chaos. To tax the income of newspapers did not in any way offend the freedom of speech and expression. The Drafting Committee Chairman did not accept these arguments. He reasoned that as long as the taxation was reasonable and non-discriminatory it did not go against the freedom of speech and expression. Eventually entry 88-A was approved by the Assembly to be included in the Union List of the Seventh Schedule.
The Assembly systematically took up each entry for discussion and went about the proceedings over the course of 9 days. Finally, the Seventh Schedule with all the amendments was adopted as part of the Constitution.
