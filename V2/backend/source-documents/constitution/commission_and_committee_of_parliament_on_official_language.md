Summary
Draft Article 301B was absent in the
Draft Constitution 1948
. A Drafting Committee Member introduced this provision on
12 September 1949
. The Draft Article set up a mechanism to evaluate the use of the official language of India. The President would appoint a commission periodically with members representing various languages to evaluate the use of Hindi and English as the official language of the Union. This Commission would then make recommendations to a committee comprising members of Parliament who would in turn examine the recommendations and file a report with the President. The President is empowered to issue directions based on the report. This provision was discussed on
12
,
13
and
14
September 1949.
A Member
proposed
that the Commission should be appointed by the President before 5 years from the commencement from the Constitution. This was to ensure that the Commissions could make its recommendations prior to the expiry of the 5-year period. Further, he also
suggested
that the Committee with legislators should be empowered to add their own recommendations to the report submitted to the President.
Another Member
proposed
an alternative mechanism with just one committee comprising of members of Parliament who would make recommendations to the President. This committee would be constituted within 3 months of the commencement of the Constitution. The President would present the recommendations with an explanation of the action to be taken before Parliament.
The Assembly
rejected
these amendments without substantial debate.
Draft Article 301B was
adopted
on 14 September 1949.
