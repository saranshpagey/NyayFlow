Summary
Draft Article 68 (Article 83), was debated on
18 May 1949
. It prescribed the duration of each of the Houses of Parliament.
The Chairman of the Drafting Committee
moved
an amendment that sought to replace the words ‘
by the President
’ in the proviso, with ‘
by Parliament by law
’. He argued that this extraordinary power during Emergency should be with the Parliament and not the President. Other members opposed this amendment as they believed that the President, who is representative of the nation, must be given the power to extend the duration of the Parliament. One member
opposed
the draft article in its entirety, claiming that regardless of the nature of the emergency, people should have the right to elect new representatives every five years.
Another member
moved
an amendment that sought to maintain the 5-year symmetry of election in the House of People: through this amendment, the mover proposed that the term of the House of People elected after emergency must be only for the remaining period ‘
for which it would have been elected if the dissolution had taken place in the normal course
’.
The Assembly
adopted
the Draft Article on 18 May 1949 with minor amendments moved by the Drafting Committee.
