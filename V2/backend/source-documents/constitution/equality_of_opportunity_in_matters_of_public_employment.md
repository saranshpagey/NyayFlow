Summary
Draft Article 10 (Article 16) was debated on
30 November 1948
. It provided for equality of opportunity in all government employment. It stated that no citizen can be discriminated on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, or residence for government employment. It also allowed the State to make reservations in public employment for citizens from any backward class.
While some members wanted a residence criterion for employment in a state government, others didn’t want any such restrictions. Arguments in favour of the residence criteria
claimed
that in certain cases, only natives of a particular state could efficiently discharge their duties as officers of the state government. The responses to these arguments
invoked
the idea of common citizenship in the Constitution, which would be undermined by the residence criteria.
There were three main points of view about having reservations in public employment during the Assembly debate.
First
was that there must be equality of opportunity for all citizens, i.e. every individual who is qualified for a particular post should freely be able to apply for the post, sit for the examinations and have his qualifications tested. There should be no limitations to this principle.
The
second
view was that the principle of equality should be operative but without any reservations for any class or community. All the citizens that are qualified should be placed on an equal footing for public services.
The
third
point of view, which was shared by the Chairman of the Drafting Committee, was that while equality of opportunity was a great principle in theory, there must be a provision that allowed the entry of those communities who were far outside of the administration in the past.
The Assembly also discussed the use of the term ‘
backward class
’ in the Draft Article. While some
preferred
the term due to its generality and ability to encompass a wider range of communities, others
argued
that the generality of term introduced a sense of vagueness; specific terms like ‘
Scheduled Caste
’ were better.
The Draft Article was
adopted
with some amendments on the same day, that is 30 November 1948.
