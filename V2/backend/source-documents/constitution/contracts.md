Summary
Draft Article 273 (Article 299, Constitution of India 1950) was debated on
15 June 1949
. The Draft Article stated that the contracts entered into by the Union or State governments will be made and executed in the name of the President or Governor of the State respectively. However, it also declared that the President or Governor would not be personally liable for these contracts.
The Draft Article only dealt with States which were former British provinces and so the Drafting Committee Chairman introduced an
amendment
to include the Princely States in this provision. The Assembly adopted this amendment without any discussion.
A Member was
concerned
that the Parliament was not involved in finalising these contracts and proposed that these contracts be ratified by Parliament. Other Members
responded
suggesting that this was not necessary as the contracts would (have to) adhere to laws made by Parliament.
Another Member
felt
that the impunity granted to the President and Governor under clause (2) of the Draft Article was not required. Countering this, the Drafting Committee Chairman
argued
that the President and Governor would be acting as agents of the Union and the State and therefore cannot be held personally liable.
The Assembly adopted this Draft Article 273 on
15 June 1949
.
