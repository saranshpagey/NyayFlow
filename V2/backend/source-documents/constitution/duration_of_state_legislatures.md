Summary
Draft Article 151 (Article 172) was debated on
2 June 1949
. It set out the duration of the State Legislative Assemblies and Councils.
A member
moved
an amendment to insert a proviso to clause (1), allowing Parliament to extend the operation of the Legislative Assembly by one year at a time during an Emergency. He
pointed
out that this was analogous to the provisions of Draft Article 68 (Article 83) which applied to Parliament. In response, another member
claimed
that this was ‘wholly undemocratic’ and could be used as an excuse for the Assemblies to hold on to power, as they could refuse to conduct elections during such periods. However, the amendment was
accepted
by the Assembly.
The Chairman of the Drafting Committee
moved
an amendment to clause (2), requiring one-third of members in the State Legislative Councils to retire every two years, rather than three. This amendment was
accepted
without debate.
One other amendment was
withdrawn
. The amended Draft Article was
adopted
on 2 June 1949.
