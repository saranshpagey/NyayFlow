Summary
Draft Article 135 (Article 158) was debated on
31st May 1949
and
14th October 1949
. It laid out the conditions of service for a Governor.
The Chairman of the Drafting Committee
moved
that clause (1) be amended to prevent a member of ‘
either House of Parliament or of a House
’ of any State Legislature from being appointed as a Governor. The Chairman also
proposed
the amendment of clause (2) to read ‘The Governor shall not hold any other office of profit’. Both were accepted by the Assembly.
Another member of the House
proposed
that the requirement for the Governor to have an official residence be deleted. He
argued
that it was unnecessary to mention such a minor detail in the Constitution, and that other Constitutions did not include similar provisions. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee
responded
that this was analogous to Draft Article 48 (
Article 59
) which set out the official residence of the President. This amendment was
negatived
.
The amended Draft Article was initially
adopted
on 31st May 1949.
Subsequently, a member of the Drafting Committee
proposed
to amend clause (3) to explicitly entitle a Governor to rent-free use of his official residence. He
contended
that this was necessary in light of a
similar amendment
to Draft Article 48 relating to the President’s official residence. The same member also
proposed
that the Draft Article be amended to permit Parliament to determine the emoluments and allowances payable to a Governor, rather than the concerned State Legislature. He
argued
that this was necessary since a Governor would be appointed by the President, and therefore it was improper for a State Legislature to deliberate on the matter.
Both amendments were
accepted
without much opposition on 14th October 1949.
