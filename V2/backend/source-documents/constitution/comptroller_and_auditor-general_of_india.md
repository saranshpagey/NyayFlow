Summary
Draft Article 124 (Article 148) was debated on
30th May 1949
. It established the office of the Auditor-General of India and laid out conditions relating to his conditions of service.
A number of amendments were proposed by one member of the Drafting Committee. Firstly, he
proposed
to replace the word ‘Auditor-General’ with the words ‘Comptroller and Auditor-General’. He
argued
that the latter better illustrated the function of the Auditor-General, who not only audited but also had some control over government expenses.
The same member of the Drafting Committee also moved two amendments to bring the Auditor-General’s rights and powers in line with the Supreme Court. Firstly, he
proposed
an amendment to clause (4) which allowed the Auditor-General to make rules relating to the conditions of service for his staff, subject to law made by Parliament and presidential approval in certain cases. Secondly, he
proposed
that all administrative expenses, including salaries, would be charged to the revenues of India. He
contended
that these amendments were non-controversial, as they were based on previously accepted principles of parity among civil servants. These amendments received the popular support of the Assembly. However, one member
expressed
strong opposition to the second amendment, arguing that the practice of charging anything to revenue should be done away with completely.
Another member
proposed
that clause (1) be amended to require that the Auditor-General be appointed by the President ‘
by warrant under his hand and seal
’. He contended that this was necessary as similar language was used in Draft Article 103 (Article 124) to describe the appointment of the Chief Justice of India by the President. This amendment
received
the support of the Chairman of the Drafting Committee.
All of the proposed amendments were accepted by the Assembly. The amended Draft Article was
adopted
on 30th May 1949.
