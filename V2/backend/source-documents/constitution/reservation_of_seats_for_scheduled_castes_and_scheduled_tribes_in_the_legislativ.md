SUMMARY
Draft Article 294 (Article 332 of Constitution of India 1950) was taken up in the Constituent Assembly on
24 Aug
ust 1949
. This Draft Article reserved seats for the Muslim, Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) communities in legislative assemblies across India. For Indian Christians, seats were reserved only in the Bombay and Madras legislative assemblies. The Draft Article placed a 10-year time limit on these reservations.
The Drafting Committee Chairman
proposed
to amend this Draft Article to remove reservations for Muslims and Indian Christians – a decision that the Assembly
had
previously taken on 26 May 1949.
Most Members supported this Draft Article but nonetheless voiced some concerns. A Member
was
not sure
if SC and ST communities would benefit from reservation. Another Member
responded
by stating that reservation was invaluable to bring public attention to the grievances of the SC/ST community. Further, the Assembly was alerted to a key objective of reservation: to compensate for the historical wrongs these communities had endured.
One Member
opposed
the 10-year time limit for reservations as insufficient to significantly alter the social and political status of SC/ST communities. He
wanted
to extend these reservations to local bodies and the executive as well. The Assembly did not discuss these concerns further.
At the end of the debate, the Assembly
adopted
the Draft Article along with the Drafting Committee Chairman’s amendment.
In
1987
and
1992
, Article 332 was amended to provide for reservation of seats for SC/ST communities in the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura.
