Summary
Draft Article 149 (Article 170) was debated on
6
,
7
and
8 January
, and on 14 October 1949. It laid out the composition of the State Legislative Assemblies.
The Chairman of the Drafting Committee
moved
an amendment to the proviso to clause (3), which would set the minimum and maximum limits on representatives as 60 and 450 respectively. A member of the Drafting Committee
proposed
that there should be one representative for every 75,000 residents. The Chairman
withdrew
his amendment, while the one
proposed
by the member of the Drafting Committee was accepted.
Another member then
proposed
the exclusion of the autonomous districts of Assam and the Cantonment and Municipality of Shillong from this clause. This was
supported
by another member, who argued that the current Draft Article would disenfranchise tribal people living in an area with a significant non-tribal population. This amendment was accepted by the Assembly.
A number of other amendments were negatived and withdrawn. The amended Draft Article was
adopted
on 8 January 1949.
Subsequently, a member of the Drafting Committee
moved
an amendment to delete clause (2), which had become unnecessary as the Assembly had now adopted Draft Article 289B (Article 326) which dealt with elections to State Legislatures. The same member also
proposed
an amendment to bestow the powers under clause (4) on Parliament, instead of the State Legislatures, because the same powers had been given to Parliament under Draft Article 290 (Article 327).
Both amendments were
adopted
on
14 October 1949
.
