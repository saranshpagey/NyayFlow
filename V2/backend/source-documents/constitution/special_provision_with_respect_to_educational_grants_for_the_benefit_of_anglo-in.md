SUMMARY
Draft Article 298 (Article 337 of Constitution of India 1950) was taken up for discussion on
16 June1949
. It gave the Union and the States the power to make educational grants for the benefit of the Anglo-Indian community.
One Member
felt
that the Draft Article would only create more barriers of separation between the Anglo-Indian community and the general population. In similar vein, another Member
said
that the provision would further communalism and wanted the Assembly to reject the Draft Article.
The Constituent Assembly did not agree, it
adopted
the Draft Constitution without amendment.
