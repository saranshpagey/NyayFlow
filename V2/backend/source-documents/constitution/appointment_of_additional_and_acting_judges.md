Appointment of additional and acting Judges
(1) If by reason of any temporary increase in the business of a High Court or by reason of arrears of work therein, it appears to the President that the number of the Judges of that Court should be for the time being increased, the President
may, in consultation with the National Judicial Appointments Commission, appoint duly qualified persons to be additional Judges of the Court for such period not exceeding two years as he may specify.
(2) When any Judge of a High Court other than the Chief Justice is by reason of absence or for any other reason unable to perform the duties of his office or is appointed to act temporarily as Chief Justice, the President may, in consultation with the National Judicial Appointments Commission, appoint a duly qualified person to act as a Judge of that Court until the permanent Judge has resumed his duties.
(3) No person appointed as an additional or acting Judge of a High Court shall hold office after attaining the age of sixty-two years.

Summary
Draft Article 200 (Article 224) was debated on
7th June 1949
. It provided for the appointment of additional and acting judges to the High Courts.
A member
proposed
to amend the Draft Article so that the Chief Justice of a High Court had to obtain the consent of the President in order to appoint additional and acting judges. He
argued
that recalling a retired judge to the Bench amounted to a new appointment; since the President was the appointing authority for the judiciary, no judge should be called back to the Bench without his consent. In response, one member
argued
that the Chief Justice would be more familiar with the abilities of retired justices and that there was no reason to involve the President in the day-to-day administration of the Court. This amendment was
adopted
.
The Chairman of the Drafting Committee
proposed
a minor amendment to the language of the Draft Article. This was also
adopted
by the Assembly with little debate.
