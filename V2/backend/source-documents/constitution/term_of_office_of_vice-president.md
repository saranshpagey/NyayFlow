Summary
Draft Article 56 was discussed on 29th December 1948. It laid down the term of the Vice-President’s office.
There was a proposal to specify the emoluments including a salary of INR 4500 per month, residential and post-retirement benefits. The mover argued that if the President’s residential benefits were laid down in the Constitution, similar provisions must be made for the Vice-President. Further, the post-retirement benefits would ensure that candidates from economically underprivileged backgrounds were provided with equal opportunity to compete in the Vice-Presidential elections.
A member wanted to include grounds of disqualifications including violation of the Constitution, a conviction of a crime, mental incapacity and corruption. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee responded by highlighting that ‘want of confidence’ in clause b covers the grounds mentioned in the member’s amendment- there was no need to specifically mention it in the Constitution.
Another member sought clarity with respect to removal of the Vice-President. The Draft Article did not specify the required majority to remove the Vice-President. Further, the member was puzzled with the removal process of the Vice-President being more stringent than that of the President. Vice-President’s removal required the Resolution to be passed by both houses of the Parliament but that of President’s required only one. A member moved an amendment which would require 2/3rd majority from both the houses of the Parliament to remove the Vice-President. He stressed that since the Vice-President’s role is important, his removal must not be a casual affair. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee pointed out that the Vice-President’s primary role is that as the Chairman of the Council of States. Hence his removal process is similar to that of the Speaker of House of People – there was no need for a 2/3rd majority.
The Assembly adopted the Draft Article without any amendments.
