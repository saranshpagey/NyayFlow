Summary
Draft Article 85 (Article 105) was debated on
19 May 1949
and
16 October 1949
. It conferred privileges and immunities to the Parliament and its members.
A member
moved
an amendment to insert ‘or any committee thereof’ in clause 4. He
argued
that the immunity under this Draft Article should not only be conferred to the members of the Parliament, but also non-members who might be a part of any committee set up by the Parliament. He anticipated that the committees would call upon experts and other professions for their testimonies and such persons must have the same parliamentary privileges. This amendment was
adopted
.
Another member
proposed
to add a new clause which would make the Parliament the final judge on any issue relating to the privilege and such orders passed would be enforceable by the officers of the Parliament. The Assembly
rejected
this proposal.
A member was concerned with the effect of this Draft Article on the freedom of the press. He
noted
that any such speech or proceedings which the Parliament could publish, the press must have an analogous right. The Draft Article’s disregard to the freedom of the press was a lacuna that needed to be addressed. He further
objected
to clause (3) which noted that the members of the Parliament enjoyed privileges of the members of the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. He noted that the privileges of the members of the House of Commons were not codified in a statute. Instead was a matter of precedents that could be understood through common law textbooks. This would put a heavy burden on the Indian parliamentarians, as they would have to hire or seek help from the English lawyers to better understand their privileges. A member of the Drafting Committee
noted
that the members of the House of Commons enjoyed the ‘widest privileges’. If the Constitution had to merely encode the existing privileges of the Provincial Legislatures, that would be restrictive: the right to punish a person for contempt of the Parliament would be absent. He further clarified that Australian and Canadian Constitutions had similar direct reference to the House of Commons.
The Constituent Assembly
adopted
the Draft Article as amended on 19 May 1949. Further, the Assembly
accepted
minor amendments on 16 October 1949.
