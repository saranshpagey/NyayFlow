Summary
Draft Article 110 (Article 132) was debated on
3 June 1949
. It conferred appellate jurisdiction to the Supreme Court for cases emerging from the High Courts that involved crucial questions on the interpretation of the Constitution.
A member
sought
to substitute ‘State’ in clause 1 with ‘territory of India’. He
argued
that ‘State’ would have a more restrictive scope – it would leave out provinces which would be acquired and would join India.
There was a
proposal
to omit ‘as to the interpretation of this Constitution’ from clauses (1) and (3). He
pointed
out that by qualifying an issue to be a substantive question of law relating to the interpretation of the Constitution, crucial questions and defects relating to other laws would be unchallenged. ‘Grossest violations’ in the Indian Penal Code, the Evidence Act and other laws could not be appealed to the Supreme Court. Consequentially, the High Courts must be empowered to grant appeal certificate to all cases including issues on substantive questions of law. Since the Supreme Court would be vested with the powers of the erstwhile Privy Council and Federal Courts, there was no need to restrict the Supreme Court’s appellate jurisdiction.
A member from the Drafting Committee
responded
to the above concerns. He clarified the scope of the Draft Article:
‘irrespective of any value, if a substantial question as to the interpretation of the constitution arises, an appeal lies to the Supreme Court’
. So, the Draft Article dealt solely with constitutional questions. With respect to claims relating to other laws/subject matters, subsequent articles covered the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction. Draft Article 111 and 112 allowed the Court to hear appeals on a variety of issues that would cover any criminal or civil issues. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee reiterated his colleague’s arguments. He stressed that the Draft Article concerned jurisdiction regarding only constitutional issues, other issues are covered under Draft Article 111.
The Assembly
accepted
a minor amendment as moved by the Drafting Committee – other proposals were negatived. The Article was
adopted
on 3 June 1949.
