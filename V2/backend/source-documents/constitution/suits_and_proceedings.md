Summary
Draft Article 274 (Article 300, Constitution of India 1950) was debated on
15 June 1949
. The Draft Article stated that the Government of India and the Government of States can sue and can be sued by the name of Government of India or the name of the State respectively. It also stated that any legal proceedings pending from prior to the commencement of the Constitution against the Dominion of India or a Province would be substituted by the Government of India or the corresponding State respectively.
The Drafting Committee Chairman
moved
a few amendments to change the language of the Draft Article while retaining its substance.
Certain members were
concerned
that the Draft Article was too obscure. The Drafting Committee Chairman did not directly engage with the concern of obscurity but
stated
that the Draft Article merely prescribed the way in which suits and proceedings should be initiated and had no other significance.
The amendments and the Draft Article were
adopted
on the same day with no further discussion or debate.
