Summary
Draft Article 313 (Article 392) was discussed in the Constituent Assembly on
7 October 1949
. This transitional provision gave the President the temporary power to alter, add or repeal constitutional provisions to specifically combat any difficulties that may arise during the transition to the new Constitution from the
Government of India Act 1935
.
Some Members opposed the Draft Article, arguing that it gave the President extensive powers to modify the Constitution and allowed him to make such changes based on his individual discretion. They
expressed
fears that the President was vested with such wide powers without a clarity on how long he would have such power. Members
preferred
that Parliament, rather than the President, be empowered with such powers. A Member
suggested
that the President could make changes based on the recommendations of Parliament or the State Legislature. Alternatively, any changes initiated by the President should be laid before Parliament for its approval.
Defending the Draft Article, the Drafting Committee Chairman
argued
that there were bound to be some difficulties arising during the transition period, that the Drafting Committee or Constituent Assembly may not be able to foresee. In addition, he
felt
that the Provisional Parliament would be too occupied with other matters to have the time to deal with these issues which might need immediate attention. Hence, it was important that the President have the power to bring about an effective and immediate remedy. This power would also
automatically end
when a new Parliament under the new Constitution comes into place.
The proposed Draft Article, as amended by the Drafting Committee Chairman, was
adopted
as part of the Constitution on 7 October 1949.
