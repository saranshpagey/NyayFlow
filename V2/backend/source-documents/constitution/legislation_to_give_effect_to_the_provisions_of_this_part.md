Summary
Article 35 gives Parliament the exclusive power to make laws relating to Articles
16
(3),
32
(3),
33
and
34
. Further, this Article enables the Parliament to prescribe punishment to offences under the fundamental rights part. The Draft Article was debated on
9 December 1948
.
The original Draft Article, as introduced by the Drafting Committee, gave Parliament the power to make laws related to any fundamental rights. However, the Chairman of the Drafting Committee
moved
an amendment to restrict this to specific fundamental rights under Articles 16 (3), 32 (3), 33 and 34. One member was
concerned
by this move: he argued that the amendment would dilute the legislative powers of the Parliament. In response, the Chairman of the Drafting Committee
noted
that through his amendment ‘
only in specific matters that Parliament has been given this penal authority
’. His amendment merely reiterates the specific legislative power under Articles 16 (3), 32 (3), 33 and 34.
The amendments moved by the Chairman of the Drafting Committee were accepted. The Assembly
adopted
the Article, as amended, on
9 December 1948
.
