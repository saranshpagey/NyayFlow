Representation of the Anglo-Indian Community in the House of the People
Notwithstanding anything in article 81, the President may, if he is of opinion that the Anglo-Indian community is not adequately represented in the House of the People, nominate not more than two members of that community to the House of the People.
VERSION 1
Article 293, Draft Constitution of India 1948

VERSION 2
Article 331, Constitution of India 1950
Notwithstanding anything in article 81, the President may, if he is of opinion that the Anglo-Indian community is not adequately represented in the House of the People, nominate not more than two members of that community to the House of the People.
SUMMARY
Draft Article 293 (Article 331, Constitution of India 1950) was discussed on
24 August 1949
.
The Draft Article gave the President the power to appoint two members from the Anglo Indian community to the Lok Sabha if the President was of the opinion that the community wasn’t adequately represented.
A Member
moved
an
amendment
to allow the President to nominate ‘an adequate number’ of any minority committee to the Lok Sabha, and not limit the nominations by number or community. Another member was
worried
that the amendment would set a dangerous precedent especially since there was already an Article (Article 81) that already dealt with the representation of minority communities. A third member
argued
that Draft Article 293 was an exception to the earlier Article and was necessary because the Anglo-Indian community was extremely small and needed to be represented in the Lok Sabha.
The amendment was
rejected
by the Assembly, and the Draft Article was
adopted
without any changes on the same day.
