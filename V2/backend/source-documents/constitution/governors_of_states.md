Provided that nothing in this article shall prevent the appointment of the same person as Governor for two or more States.

Article 153, Constitution of India 1950

Summary
Draft Article 129 (Article 153) was debated on
30th May 1949
. It stipulated that each State would have a Governor.
One member
proposed
an amendment to mandate that there would be at least one Governor ‘
from each of the States in Part I of the First Schedule
’. He
argued
that this was necessary to ensure that all states were adequately represented in government services. Although the principle of adequate representation received support, a member
believed
that the question should be addressed while discussing the appointment of Governors.
Another member
argued
that it was unnecessary to have Governors in the first place, and that the Centre should instead have administrative control over the states. He
contended
that provincial autonomy was only necessary during colonial rule, and symbolized distrust of national government. He received the support of a member who
argued
that the basis of the semi-federal structure of the Draft Constitution was the
Government of India Act, 1935
and was therefore not an indigenous idea. This member further
argued
that although the Assembly had already adopted this system of governance, the state administrations had proven too unstable and therefore a unitary constitution was the need of the hour. The other members of the Assembly
disagreed
with these comments as being ‘
out of order
’ because the broad principles of the Constitution had already been previously decided.
The proposed amendment was
negatived
. The Draft Article was
adopted
on 30th May 1949. It was later amended by the
Constitution (7th Amendment) Act, 1956
.
