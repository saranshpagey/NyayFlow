Summary
Draft Constitution 89 (Article 109) was discussed on
20 May 1949
. It provided for a special procedure to pass Money Bills.
A member
moved
an amendment to replace ‘thirty days’ to ‘twenty one days’ in clauses (2) and (5). He
argued
that practically, after introducing a Money Bill, one House would not take more than a week to transfer it to the other House for recommendations. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee further
proposed
to reduce the time limit to fourteen days. He
noted
that unlike Britain, the Indian Constitution empowered the House of Councils to interfere and recommend on financial matters. And budget-related matters require to be moved expeditiously.
The Assembly
accepted
to reduce the time limit to thirty days and
adopted
the Draft Article on 20 May 1949.
