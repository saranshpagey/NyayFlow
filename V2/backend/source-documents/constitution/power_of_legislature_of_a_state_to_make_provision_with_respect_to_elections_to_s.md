Subject to the provisions of this Constitution and in so far as provision in that behalf is not made by Parliament, the Legislature of a State may from time to time by law make provision with respect to all matters relating to, or in connection with, the elections to the House or either House of the Legislature of the State including the preparation of electoral rolls and all other matters necessary for securing the due constitution of such House or Houses.

Version 2
Article 328, Constitution of India 1950
Subject to the provisions of this Constitution and in so far as provision in that behalf is not made by Parliament, the Legislature of a State may from time to time by law make provision with respect to all matters relating to, or in connection with, the elections to the House or either House of the Legislature of the State including the preparation of electoral rolls and all other matters necessary for securing the due constitution of such House or Houses.
Summary
Draft Article 291 (Article 328, Constitution of India 1950) was discussed on
16 June 1949
. The Draft Article gave the State Legislatures the power to make provisions with respect to elections to the State Legislature(s) and delimit constituencies.
The Drafting Committee Chairman
moved
an amendment that would allow the State Legislature to make provisions on matters related to elections only if the Parliament had not already done so. He
moved
another amendment to change the powers of the Parliament to include preparation of electoral rolls and all other necessary matters.
A member was
concerned
that the Draft Article could create ‘some sort of friction or tension between the Parliament and the State Legislature…’ The Drafting Chairman
clarified
that the State Legislature would only have residuary powers and that it could only make provisions on matters that the Parliament had failed to make provisions on.
Both amendments were
accepted
by the Assembly without any debate.
The amended Draft Article was
adopted
into the Constitution on the same day.
