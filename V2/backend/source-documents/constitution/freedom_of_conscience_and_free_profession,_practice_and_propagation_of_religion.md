Summary
Draft Article 19 (Article 25) was debated on
3
and
6 December 1948
. It gave Indians the individual right to religious freedom subject to some restrictions.
There debate revolved around two key questions: Would the right to propagate religion facilitate forced conversions? Should the social welfare and reform clause extend to Buddhists, Jains and Christians?
Some members
were
concerned that the right to propagate would permit forced conversions. They proposed amendments to remove the
right
to propagate religion, or even to
limit
the right to practice religion to the private domain solely. This was opposed by other members who
felt
that there was nothing in the Draft Article that facilitated forced conversions. They added that the right to propagate religion would lead to public awareness about different religions and promote communal understanding and peace. The amendments were
rejected
by the Assembly.
One Member
wanted
the scope of subclause (b) of clause (2) of the Draft Article to extend beyond Hindus to Buddhists, Jains and Christians. He
argued
that this would promote religious harmony among people following different belief systems. Although this amendment was initially
rejected
by the Assembly, the Drafting Committee later extended the clause to Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains.
The Draft Article was
adopted
with minor amendments on 6 December 1948.
