Summary
Draft Article 83 (Article 102) was debated on
19 May 1949
and
13 October 1949
. It laid down grounds for disqualification of the members of the Parliament.
A member
moved
an amendment to delete sub-clause (e) of clause 1. He
argued
that this Draft Article laid down comprehensive grounds of disqualification of the members of parliament, empowering the future parliaments to expand on these grounds would be ‘dangerous’. Political parties might use this to disqualify their opponents. Another member
echoed
a similar view – he strongly urged for not giving the future Parliaments power to add to the list of disqualifications. Further, he
proposed
a set of additional grounds that included conviction based on offences relating elections, moral turpitude. In
rebuttal
to this, a member believed that the future legislature would not abuse its lawmaking power under this provision. He argued that a legitimate Parliament which represented the will of the people should have the liberty to legislate on this matter.
A member was concerned with the phrasing of sub-clause (b) of clause 1 and
favoured
deletion of ‘declared by a competent court’. He noted that less than ten per cent of persons institutionalised for unsound mind had a declaration from a court. Only people with property and financial backing would be in a position to obtain a court decree.
None
of these proposals was successful. The Constituent Assembly
accepted
the Draft Article 19 May 1949 and
adopted
a minor amendment on 13 October 1949.
