Summary
The Constituent Assembly debated Draft Article 48 on
27 December 1948
and
14 October 1949
. The Draft Article laid down conditions for the President’s office including emoluments and benefits.
There was a
proposal
to ensure that if the President-elect was a ruler from a Princely state he/she would be required to give away his/her privy purse based pension/allowance. This would be
consistent
with the democratic and republican ideals of the Constitution. The Chair of the Drafting Committee
suggested
that this issue was better dealt with later when the Princely states accede to the Indian union.
A member
wanted
to delete ‘
the President shall have an official residence
’ from clause 3. He was against the insertion of such ‘
insignificant, such a minor details
’ in the Constitution; He
noted
that the American Constitution did not mention the White House. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee, in defence,
pointed
out that the
Government of India Act 1935
and several other British Orders laid down official residences of the Governor-General and Governors. The Drafting Committee was merely encoding an already existing precedent.
Another member moved an amendment to
add
retirement benefits in the Draft Article. He
argued
that this provision was novel and even the American Constitution missed including such a provision. A host of officers including the Prime Minister, Leader of Opposition and judges of the higher judiciary enjoy pension post-retirement. It was important to
extend
this benefit to the former sovereign head of the nation. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee
found
this impractical. He noted that if a person were to be re-elected as a President, according to the proposal, he/she would be entitled to a pension for his/her previous term as President in addition to a salary for his/her current term and salary. He, however, conceded that providing pension to the President was a ‘laudable idea’, an initiative that future Parliaments would take forward.
The Assembly rejected all substantive proposals. On 27 December 1948, it
adopted
the Draft Article with minor amendments. On 14th October 1949, the Assembly re-opened this Article and
adopted
minor amendments.
