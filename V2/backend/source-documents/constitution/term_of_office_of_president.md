Summary
Draft Article 45 provided for the term of the President’s office. The Article was debated on
13 December 1948
.
The debate around this Draft Article was rather short. A member proposed that the Article be
amended
to ensure that ‘President who is elected in a casual vacancy will also hold office only for the remaining term of five years’. Another member wanted to
amend
the Article to mandate the President to address Parliament in case of resignation. He
argued
that while the President may hand over the resignation letter to the Speaker or Chairman, they have a responsibility to address the Parliament which elected them.
The proposals were not accepted by the Assembly. The Draft Article was
adopted
without amendment.
