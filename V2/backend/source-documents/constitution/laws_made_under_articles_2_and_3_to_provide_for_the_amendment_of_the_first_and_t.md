Summary
Article 4 (Draft Article 4) was discussed on
18 November 1948
. It regulated laws made under Articles 2 and 3.
There was no substantive debate on this Draft Article. One member, in the interest of brevity,
sought
to substitute ‘
article 2 and article 3
’ with ‘
article 2 and 3
’. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee
opposed
this. He noted that the Drafting Committee followed a common foreign precedent. Furthermore, the
Government of India Act 1935
had also used this format.
This amendment was subsequently
rejected
by the Constituent Assembly, and it
adopted
the Article on 18 November 1948.
