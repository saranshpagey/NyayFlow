Summary
Draft Article 130 (Article 154) was debated on
30th May 1949
and
16th October 1949
. It vested the executive power of a state in its Governor.
A member
proposed
an amendment to clause (1) to replace the word ‘may’ with ‘shall’. He
argued
that the use of ‘may’ indicated that it was not binding on the Governor to exercise his powers in accordance with the Constitution and the law.
Another member
proposed
an amendment to the effect that the Governor’s power was exercised ‘
on behalf of the people
’.
A third member expressed discomfort with the use of the word ‘transfer’ in the context of clause (2), and
proposed
to replace it with the words ‘
authorise or empower
’. He
contended
that the latter was more accurate as functions were attached to a specific role and could not be transferred.
The Chairman of the Drafting Committee was against the proposed amendments. He
reminded
the Assembly that the current Draft Article was a reproduction of Draft Article 42 (
Article 53
) relating to the executive powers of the Union, and similar amendments had been rejected during the debates on that Draft Article.
All three amendments were
negatived
by the Assembly. The Draft Article was initially
adopted
on 30th May 1949.
Subsequently, the language of Draft Article 42 was
amended
. A member of the Drafting Committee
proposed
that the words ‘
may be exercised by him
‘ be substituted for ‘
shall be exercised by him either directly or through officers subordinate to him
‘, in order to mirror the language used in Draft Article 42. The amendment was
accepted
on 16th October 1949.
