The Governor may by public notification direct that the foregoing provisions of this Chapter and any rules made thereunder shall with effect from such date as may be fixed by him in that behalf apply in relation to any class or classes of magistrates in the State as they apply in relation to persons appointed to the judicial service of the State subject to such exceptions and modifications as may be specified in the notification.
Summary
Draft Article 209E (Article 237) was discussed on
16 September 1949
. It was not initially included in the Draft Constitution, 1948. Instead, the Chairman of the Drafting Committee
proposed
to insert the following as Draft Article 209E:
“
The Governor may by public notification direct that the foregoing provisions of this Chapter and any rules made thereunder shall with effect from such date as may be fixed by him in this behalf apply in relation to any class or classes of magistrates in the State as they apply in relation to persons appointed to the judicial service of the State subject to such exceptions and modifications as may be specified in the notification.
”
The Draft Article allowed the Governor to make Chapter VI applicable to any class or classes of magistrates.
A member
proposed
that after the words ‘may’, where it occurs for the first time, the words ‘at any time’ be inserted. This was
rejected
without debate.
Another member
proposed
to amend the Article to ensure that its provisions were implemented within five years. This amendment was also
rejected
without debate.
Draft Article 209E was
adopted
on 16 September 1949.
