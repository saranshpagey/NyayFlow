SUMMARY
Draft Article 223 (Article 248, Constitution of India 1950) was debated on

. It gave the Union Parliament residuary powers to make laws on subjects that were not mentioned in the State and Concurrent lists. There was no substantive debate on this Draft Article and it was
adopted
without amendment.
Subsequently, the

Article 246A
. Article 246A dealt with the power to make laws in relation to goods and services tax (GST).
