Summary
Article 3 (Draft Article 3) was debated on
17
and
18 November 1948
, and
13 October 1949
. It empowered Parliament to make law relating to the formation of new states and alteration of existing states.
One member strongly
believed
that the proposal to alter an existing State must originate from the concerned State Legislature and not the parliament. The State Legislature and the people residing in a State must be consulted and involved in this decision. He further argued that a ‘
democratic regime
’ must consult the stakeholders of a decision and not merely impose top-down orders. The Draft Article in its current form compromised federalism and
granted
unnecessary and excessive powers to the Centre.
Not all were convinced by these arguments. Another member
pointed out
that this proposal would stifle minority demands for separate states as it would be impossible to get a State to support its own separation. Further, the Chairman of the Drafting Committee found this proposal unnecessary in light of an
amendment
moved by him. Through the amendment, he sought to include a clause requiring the President to consult with the concerned states prior to passing any law under this Article.
The Assembly
adopted
Draft Article 3 with amendments as moved by the Drafting Committee.
