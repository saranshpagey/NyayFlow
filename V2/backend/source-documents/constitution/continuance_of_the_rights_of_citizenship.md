Version 1

Summary
Draft Article 5C (Article 10) was debated on
10
,
11
and
12 August 1949
. It was not initially part of the Draft Constitution 1948. Instead, the Chairman of the Drafting Committee
proposed
its insertion. It clarified that people declared as citizens under the preceding citizenship articles continued to be so subject to any law made by the Parliament.
While there were no substantive discussions around this Article, one member
moved a motion
to delete this article as he believed that it was unnecessary and redundant, and that Draft Article 6 (
Article 11
) was sufficient for these purposes.
The Chairman of the Drafting Committee
reiterated
that the Articles on citizenship were temporary in nature; it was to be left to the future Parliament to enact a comprehensive citizenship code.
The Assembly
adopted
this article without any amendments on 12 August 1949.
