Summary
Draft Article 204 (Article 228) was debated on
7
and
8 June 1949
. It regulated the power of the High Court to transfer cases to itself.
A member
questioned
whether it was necessary for the High Court to compulsorily try all withdrawn cases in their entirety. He suggested that the Court should have the option to decide the substantial question of law and then return it to the lower court to dispose of in conformity with this decision. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee then
proposed
to wholly substitute the Draft Article to provide this option to the High Court. Some members raised concerns about this amendment. One member
argued
that the Draft Article was unnecessary and would lead to increased costs and delays for litigants. A member of the Drafting Committee
argued
that the High Court would find it difficult to adjudicate the substantial question of constitutional law without deciding on other related questions of law. In the end, the Assembly decided to
accept
the Chairman’s amendment
The amended Draft Article was
adopted
on 8 June 1949.
