Summary
Draft Article 285C (Article 319 of Constitution of India 1950) was not included in the Draft Constitution 1948. It was introduced by the Drafting Committee Chairman on
22 August 1949
to ensure the independence of members of the Public Service Commission from political and professional biases. The Draft Article prohibited the chairman and members of the Union and State Public Service Commissions from holding certain positions of employment under the Union and State governments after serving as a member of the Public Service Commission.
A Member
moved
an amendment to replace the word ‘employment’ in Draft Article 285C with the term ‘office of profit’ instead. He
wanted
to restrict appointments to positions with monetary benefits that may not be categorised as employment. Further, he added that a member should not be debarred from serving the State in an honorary capacity without any monetary reward. Another member also
supported
this on the ground that skills of such members should be utilised without undue restrictions.
The Drafting Committee Chairman responded by
stating
that the purpose of the Draft Article is to ensure that members of the Public Service Commission are independent from the influence of the executive and they should not be enticed with any honorary position.
A Member also
proposed
that the total period of employment of a member in different public service commissions should not exceed 12 years. This was
suggested
to prevent the State from giving preferential treatment to any member by reappointing them in other public service commissions.
The members
withdrew
the above amendments and the Assembly
adopted
Draft Article 285C on the same day.
