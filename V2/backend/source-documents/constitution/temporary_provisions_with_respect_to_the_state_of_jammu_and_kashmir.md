SUMMARY
Draft Article 306A (Article 370, Constitution of India 1950) was not part of the Draft Constitution of India 1948. It was introduced in the Constituent Assembly 17 October 1949 and taken up for discussion.
The Draft Article declared that the Constitution of India would be applicable to the State of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) in accordance with the terms of the Instruments of Accession (IOA) signed by India and J&K. The IOA outlined the conditions under which J&K became a part of the Indian Union. As a result, J&K was granted a higher level of autonomy within India’s federal system. Additionally, the Draft Article provided for the establishment of the J&K Constituent Assembly with the purpose of drafting a unique J&K Constitution. This Assembly had the authority to determine which provisions of the Indian Constitution would apply to the State in the future.
A member
asked
why the Draft Article gave J&K a special constitutional status. A Drafting Committee member
responded
arguing that the unique political circumstances around J&K required such a special provision. These circumstances included the on-going war in the State, the involvement of the United Nations, and the promises made by the Indian Government to State which included the State’s right to decide its political future. Despite this clarification, the Member
appeared
unconvinced and suggested that the Draft Article was discriminatory as the other Princely States like the State of Baroda received no such political concessions.
At the end of the debate, the Constituent Assembly
adopted
the Draft Article without amendments on 17 October 1949.
On 6 August 2019, Article 370 of the Constitution was effectively repealed through a
Presidential order
on the recommendation of both Houses of Parliament.
