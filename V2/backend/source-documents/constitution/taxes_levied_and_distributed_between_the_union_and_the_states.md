SUMMARY
Draft Article 251 (Article 270, Constitution of India 1950) was discussed on
5 August 1949
. It laid down the manner of collection and distribution of of income taxes between the Union and States. This Draft Article provided that the taxes on income excluding agricultural income would be collected by the Union government and then distributed between the Union and States in accordance with this provision. The percentage and manner of distribution of such revenues would be prescribed by the President on considering the recommendations of the Finance Commission.
A Member
proposed
that a minimum percentage of revenue and manner of distribution be detailed within the Draft Article itself. He
believed
that this fixed percentage would provide certainty to State Governments and enable them to plan their budget. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee
argued
that the Constitution should not prescribe a fixed percentage of revenue share for the States, the President should decide. The amendment was
withdrawn
after the Chairman’s response.
Another member
proposed
that Parliament by law should determine the amount and manner of distribution of the taxes between the Union and States instead of the President. He felt that the recommendations of the Finance Commission must be debated in the Parliament and an appropriate legislation must be passed. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee
opposed
this amendment because it would create conflict among representatives of various States. He also believed that the distribution may not be just as some states would have more representatives in the Parliament than others. The Assembly rejected the amendment.
The Assembly
accepted
a minor amendment to replace the words ‘revenues of India’ with ‘Consolidated Fund of India’.
Draft Article 251, as amended was adopted on
5 August 1949
.
Article 270 was amended in
2000
to cover all taxes and duties referred to in the Union List-except stamp duties, tax on sale or purchase of goods and services, surcharge on certain taxes and cess collected for specific purposes.
