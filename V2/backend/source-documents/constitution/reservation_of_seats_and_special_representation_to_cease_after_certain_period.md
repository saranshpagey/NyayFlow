SUMMARY
Draft Article 295A (Article 334 of Constitution of India 1950) was absent in the Draft Constitution 1948. The Draft Article was debated on
on
24 August 1949
and
25 August 1949
.
The Draft Article stated that reservations for SC/STs in Union and State legislatures would be valid for a period of 10 years after the Constitution comes into effect.
A group of members
were
not comfortable with the time limit on reservations. They were not  sure if 10 years was
sufficient
to bring the SC/ST community to the level of other classes. One Member
wanted
the Draft Article to make it explicitly clear that time limit would only apply if the SC/ST community wasn’t adequately uplifted
. Other members
wanted
to give parliament the power to alter the time limit as it saw fit.
The Drafting Committee Chairman
confessed
he
preferred
a longer time limit, though he suggested that the Assembly stick to 10 years for now. He argued that if the SC/ST community had not been uplifted in 10 years, then the community would  invent novel ways to ensure that their reservation benefits continue. The Chairman further
stated
that
parliament
should not be given the power to change the time limit; such a change must be done through a constitutional amendment.
The Chairman’s interventions appeared to convince the Assembly and all the above proposals were
rejected or withdrawn
.
However, the Assembly accepted two amendments. The first
stated
that the
time limit
would not affect the composition of the existing legislative assemblies and the second
brought
Anglo Indian
reservations under the ambit of the Draft Article.
The Assembly adopted the Draft Article with these amendments on
25 August 1949
.
Article 334 was subsequently amended by way of the
Constitution (One Hundred and Fourth Amendment) Act, 2019
.
