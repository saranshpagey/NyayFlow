Summary
Draft Article 111 (Article 133) was debated on
3
and
6 June 1949
, and
16 October 1949
. It conferred appellate jurisdiction to the Supreme Court on civil matters pertaining to substantial questions of law.
A member
moved
an amendment to insert ‘such amount as may be fixed by law by Parliament’ in clause 1 (a). He
argued
that the pecuniary jurisdiction of the Supreme Court must not be rigid and restricted to 20,000 – the future Parliament must have the option of increasing it at appropriate times.
The Draft Article provided a general right to appeal to the Supreme Court in civil matters. There was a
proposal
to allow the Parliament to subject this right to qualifications. The member
argued
that the generality of this right would significantly increase the workload of the Supreme Court. The Parliament should have the power to regulate civil jurisdiction of the court through future legislations. A member of the Drafting Committee
supported
this amendment. As per the Draft Article, he
believed
that, if conditions of appeal had to be spelt out, it would be through a constitutional amendment. This would be undesirable – ‘It ought to be an elastic provision’. However, the Chairman of the Drafting Committee was not in favour of this proposal. He
believed
that this would reduce the power of the Supreme Court and would enable the Parliament to make drastic laws including one that may take away all civil appellate powers.
Another member lamented the specificity of the provision. He pointed out that the Constitution must not be burdened with ‘technicalities’ – the future parliament must be entrusted with explaining and qualifying the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.
The Assembly accepted a few amendments moved by the Drafting Committee – others were negatived. The Draft Article was
adopted
on 6 June 1949. The Draft Article was
reopened
on 16 October 1949 and the Drafting Committee moved a few amendments to simplify the provision.
