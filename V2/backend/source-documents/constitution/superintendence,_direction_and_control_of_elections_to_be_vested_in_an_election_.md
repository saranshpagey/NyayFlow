Summary
Draft Article 289 (Article 324, Constitution of India 1950) was discussed on
15 June 1949
and
16 June 1949
. The Draft Article creates a single Commission to deal with the elections to the Central Legislature- Upper and Lower House. It also states that each State and province should have their own Election Commission.
The Drafting Committee Chairman
moved
an amendment to substitute the Draft Article with another one. The new Draft Article proposed to centralise the election machinery. It created a single Commission that would manage elections with the assistance of regional commissioners who would be working under the control of the Central Election Commission and not the provincial government.
Another member
moved
an amendment to alter the process of appointment. The member
wanted
to ensure that the Election Commission was independent and free from executive interference. Several other members were in support of this amendment.
The core conflict that
emerged
around the amendment was placing of State Legislature elections under the purview of the Central Commission. This was a radical departure from the Draft Article 289 that put State Legislature elections under a State Commission appointed by the State Governor. The reason for the change, the Chairman of the Drafting Committee
argued
, was that there were reports that non-native citizens of a State were being discriminated against by State government agencies and this could have a detrimental effect on the independence and impartiality of the State Commission.
On the next day, the Draft Article was discussed once again. Various concerns were
raised
by members. One felt that the amendment moved by the Drafting Committee Chairman took away power from the provincial governments and left too much power in the hands of the President.
This argument was not taken well by some members of the Assembly who
felt
that the centralisation of election machinery was not an answer to undemocratic practices and the discrimination of minorities in a State. They
felt
that the Draft Article further diluted the federal idea. The federalism argument was
countered
by other members who did not see the Draft Article impinging on federalism as governments, state or central, have nothing to do with elections at all.
On the role of the President of India, the Assembly
felt
that the Drafting Committee’s amendment placed the President at a powerful position with regards to elections and in order to counter the possibility of the Central government influencing the President, it was
decided
that certain aspects of the Draft Article would be made subject to law made by parliament.
The Assembly adopted the Draft Article on
16 June 1949
, incorporating amendments including the one moved by the Drafting Committee.
