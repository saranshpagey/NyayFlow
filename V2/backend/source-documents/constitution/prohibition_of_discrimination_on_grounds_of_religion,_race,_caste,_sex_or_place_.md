Summary
Draft Article 9 (Article 15) was debated on
29 November 1948
. It prohibited discrimination on five grounds: religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth.
Some members
argued
that the Draft Article did not engage with discrimination based on family or descent. Others
wanted
a specific mention of gardens, roads and tramways as potential public spaces where people should not face discrimination. In response to these points, it was
clarified
that while the Draft Article specifically mentions some spaces, the general nature of the language used in the Article was sufficient to cover a wide range of public spaces including those that were not specified in the Article’s text.
To the clause which permitted special provisions for women and children, a member
proposed
to add other vulnerable groups, namely Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee
dismissed
the need for this addition, arguing that such a provision could allow for the lawful segregation of these groups. Therefore, this amendment was
rejected
by the Assembly.
The Draft Article was
adopted
with some amendments on the same day, that is 29 November 1948.
