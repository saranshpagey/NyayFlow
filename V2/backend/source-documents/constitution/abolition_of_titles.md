Summary
Draft Article 12 (Article 18) was debated on
30 November
and
1 December 1948
. It abolished the conferring and recognition of titles.
A member of the Drafting Committee
proposed
an amendment to clarify that titles related to military and academic distinction were exempted from the scope of the Draft Article. This was
accepted
by the Assembly without debate.
Another member
wanted to amend
clause (2) to make it explicit that the State would not recognize any titles conferred by a foreign State. He
argued
that in its present form, the Draft Article merely prohibited an Indian citizen from accepting a title but did not prohibit the State from recognizing it; further, he pointed out that no penalty or consequences were prescribed for the same.
Another member went as far to
propose
that anybody accepting such a title should be deemed to have forfeited their Indian citizenship. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee
responded
that Parliament could use its residuary powers to prescribe a penalty for this act.
The amended Draft Article was
adopted
on 1 December 1948.
