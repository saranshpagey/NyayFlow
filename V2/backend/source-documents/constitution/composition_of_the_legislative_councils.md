Summary
Draft Article 150 (Article 171) was debated on
2 June
,
30 July
and
19 August 1949
. It set out the composition of the State Legislative Councils.
The Chairman of the Drafting Committee
moved
an amendment to wholly substitute the Draft Article to the effect that Parliament was authorized to prescribe the manner and form of composition of seats in the State Legislative Councils, and the minimum criteria to be a candidate for such seats. He
argued
that the amendment was necessary because the Draft Article reflected a principle which had been earlier rejected by the Assembly; further, the Drafting Committee had been unable to form a consensus on the matter.
A member
raised
objections to allowing Parliament the freedom to dictate the composition of the State Legislative Councils. He
proposed
an amendment which laid out the composition of an electoral college for the Councils, which was supported by many members. Given these objections, the Chairman of the Drafting Committee
proposed
a new amendment which defined the electoral college for State Legislative Councils, although Parliament still retained the power to overrule this with legislation. Despite some members voicing disagreement, the Assembly
accepted
this new amendment proposed by the Chairman.
Most of the amendments to the new amendment were withdrawn, while others were negatived. The Assembly accepted one minor amendment endorsed by the Chairman of the Drafting Committee. It adopted the amended Draft Article 150 on 19 August 1949.
