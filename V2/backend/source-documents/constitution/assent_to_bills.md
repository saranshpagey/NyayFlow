Summary
Draft Article 91 (Article 111) was debated on
20 May 1949
. It regulated the President’s assent to Bills.
A member
moved
an amendment that would make it mandatory for the President to assent to a Bill. He
argued
that the President should not have a right to dissent in legislative business as he/she had a titular role and was ‘analogous to the King in England’.
In the proviso, the Chairman of the Drafting Committee
sought
to replace ‘not later than six weeks’ to ‘as soon as possible’. Another member
argued
for further amending this phrase to ‘as soon as may be’ in order to give the President more time to respond to the Bill.
After a Bill was sent back to the Parliament for reconsideration, what would happen if the President’s suggestions were not taken into account and the Parliament sent the Bill back to the President? A member
moved
an amendment to make it compulsory for the President to provide assent if it was sent by the Parliament for the second time. Another member
proposed
a very radical suggestion: if the President refused to provide assent, the House of the People would automatically dissolve and fresh elections were to be conducted. If the political party which was in power prior to the dissolution formed the government again, then the President would resign and the Bill would become an Act. In order to rectify this situation the Assembly decided to insert the following in the proviso: ‘and if the Bill is passed again by the House with or without amendment and presented to the President for assent, the President shall not withhold assent therefrom.’
The Assembly did not accept any other proposals and
adopted
the Draft Article on 20 May 1949.
