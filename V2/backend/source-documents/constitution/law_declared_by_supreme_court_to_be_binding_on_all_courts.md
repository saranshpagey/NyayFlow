Summary
Draft Article 117 (Article 141) was debated on
27th May 1949
. It stated that the Supreme Court’s decisions were binding on all courts in India.
One member proposed to amend the language of the Draft Article so that the Supreme Court’s decisions were binding on ‘
all other courts
’. He
argued
that it was unwise to bind the Supreme Court by its own decisions, as it prevented the court from rectifying mistakes in previous judgments. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee
stated
that the amendment was unnecessary because the phrase ‘all courts’ meant ‘all other courts.’ He
clarified
that the Draft Article did not bind the Supreme Court by its own decisions, and that the court was free to change its interpretation of the law as it saw fit.
The proposed amendment was negatived. The Draft Article was
adopted
by the Assembly on 27th May 1949.
