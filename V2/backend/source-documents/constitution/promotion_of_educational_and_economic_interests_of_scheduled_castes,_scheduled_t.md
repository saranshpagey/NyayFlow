Summary
Draft Article 37 (Article 46) was discussed on
23 November 1948
. It aims to promote education and economic interests for members of Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe and other weaker sections.
The central issue of the discussion was around the scope of the term ‘
Scheduled Castes
’. One member
moved
to substitute ‘
Scheduled Castes
‘ with ‘
Backward communities of whatever class or religion
‘. He
argued
that the definition of Scheduled Castes is restrictive and does not cover several backward communities like Sikh, Ramdasis, Odes, Balmiki, and Chamars. The Chairman of the Drafting Committee
remarked
that this amendment was unnecessary at this juncture. It could be considered while discussing the schedule which lists down the Scheduled Castes.
The Assembly
adopted
this Article without amendments on the same day, that is 23 November 1948.
