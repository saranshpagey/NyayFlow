SUMMARY
Draft Article 301 (Article 340) was debated in the Constituent Assembly on
16th June 1949
. It gave the President the power to appoint a Commission to investigate the conditions of the backward classes.
One member
proposed
an amendment to put the onus to take action on Parliament rather than the President. This received some support from another member, who
contended
that it was the duty of Parliament to ‘
consider ways and means of removing backwardness of the people
’.
A member
expressed
concerns that the term ‘backward classes’ was not clearly defined. He suggested that the Commission should set out the communities who came under this term. Further, another member
proposed
that the Draft Article should not be limited only those communities who enjoyed constitutional reservations.
All the amendments were
negatived
, except for a minor one
proposed
by the Chairman of the Drafting Committee. The amended Draft Article was adopted by the House on
16th June 1949
.
