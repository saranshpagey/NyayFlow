Summary
The Constituent Assembly took up Draft Article 25 for debate on
9 December 1948
. The Draft Article gives citizens the right to approach the Supreme Court for constitutional remedies when their fundamental rights are violated.
The Assembly was unanimous about the importance of the Article. Members referred to the provision in terms that included ‘
the crowning section
’ and ‘
very soul… and the very heart of the Constitution
’. However, some amendments were moved.
A member
wanted
to remove the mention of specific writs in the provision. He felt that this would constrain judges, as they would not be able to evolve new writs in the future. Another member was
unhappy
with clause 4 that allowed for the suspension of the Draft Article during an emergency which he termed as a ‘
dangerous situation
’.
It was
clarified
that the specific writs mentioned in the provision were in existence in Great Britain for a very long time, they have been tried and tested, and most lawyers, judges and jurists were familiar with them. It was further stated that it was near to impossible to improve upon the existing writs and therefore there really was no possibility of new writs emerging. On the question of suspension of the Draft Article, it was
argued
that is was reasonable to suspend or limit fundamental rights during an emergency as the very life of the State was at stake.
The Draft Article was
adopted
with some amendments on the same day, that is 9 December 1948.
