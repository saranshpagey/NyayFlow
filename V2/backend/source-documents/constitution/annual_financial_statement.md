Summary
Draft Article 92 (Article 112) was debated on
8
and
10 June 1949
, and
13 October 1949.
It directs the President of India to present an Annual Financial Statement of the Government of India’s expenditure – popularly known as the Union Budget – to the Parliament of India. It details what such a statement must contain and how it should be presented.
A member
moved
an amendment that would, in addition to the President, also allow the Finance Minister to present the Annual Financial Statement. He
pointed
out that even though the President was the head of the Executive, the Finance Minister should be given the opportunity to present the Budget – as he/she directly led the financial administration of the country. Further, he
stressed
on retaining ‘complete and exclusive supremacy’ of the Parliament on financial matters.
Additionally, this member
sought
to give the House of the People primacy over the Budget. He
argued
that equality between both the Houses on finance matters ‘fundamentally opposed to the basic idea of the Constitution’. Once the Budget was finalised, the Council of the States could be given the copy of the Budget. This would ensure that popular representative will of the people determined the financial decisions of the nation.
This member was keen to
charge
the salaries and allowances of the Ministers and the Members of the Parliament to the Consolidated Fund of India. He
argued
that clause 3 provides for salaries of a number of members of the constitutional bodies to be considered within the Consolidated Fund, Ministers and members of the Parliament must be treated in the same category.
The Assembly rejected all these proposals. It
adopted
the Article with changes as suggested by the Drafting Committee on 10 June 1949.
