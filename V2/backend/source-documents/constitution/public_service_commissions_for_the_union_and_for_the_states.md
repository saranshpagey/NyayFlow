Summary
Draft Article 284 (Article 315 Constitution of India 1950) was debated on
22 August 1949
. It stated that Union and State Public Service Commissions would be constituted. Two or more States could have one common Public Service Commission. Further, on receiving a request from the Governor of a State, the Union Public Service Commission could also address the needs of a particular State.
The Assembly President
proposed
to include the requirement for the State legislature to pass a resolution to set up a common Public Service Commission for two or more States. This joint public service commission would be set up by Parliament. Since the general principle was that each State should have its own Public Service Commission, any deviation from the same should be authorized by the respective legislatures.
Some Members
felt
that the involvement of Parliament to set up a joint public service commission was unnecessary interference in provincial affairs. However, another Member
believed
that public services should be centralized and there must be no provision for distinct state public service officials.
A Member also
urged
that the provisions on the Commissions should not be rigid and more discretion should be given to Parliament. He thought flexible provisions could help facilitate a more inclusive Commission. Others disagreed and
stated
that a comprehensive framework for these Commissions should be laid out in the Constitution to ensure its smooth functioning in the future.
The assembly
rejected
these proposals and accepted the amendment put forward by the President.
Draft Article 284 as amended was adopted on
22 August 1949
.
