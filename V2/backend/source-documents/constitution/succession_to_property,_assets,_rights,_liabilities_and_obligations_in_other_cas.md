Summary
Draft Article 270A (Article 295, of India 1950) was not included in the Draft Constitution 1948. It was
introduced
by the Drafting Committee Chairman on 13 October 1949. Draft Article 270A dealt with the property and assets of Princely States. It stated that all assets, property and contractual rights and obligations of Princely States would be transferred to the Union government after the commencement of the Constitution.
One Member wanted Parliament to
approve
this transfer in order to ‘maintain the final authority of Parliament’.
The Assembly
rejected
this amendment without any debate and
adopted
the Draft Article 270A  on the same day.
