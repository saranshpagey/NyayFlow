SUMMARY
Draft Article 238 (Article 261, Constitution of India 1950) was first discussed on
13 June 1949
. It deals with the legitimacy of public acts, records and judicial proceedings. It bestowed legitimacy on Union and State public acts, records and judicial proceedings. The value of these records as evidence would be determined by legislation.

Draft Article 238, as amended was adopted on
13 June 1949
