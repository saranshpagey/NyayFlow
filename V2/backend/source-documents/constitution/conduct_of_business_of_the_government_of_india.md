Summary
Draft Article 64 (Article 77) was debated on
7 January 1949
. This article governed the executive business of the Government of India.
A member
moved
an amendment to replace ‘
President
’ with the ‘
Government of India
’ so that all executive business was done in the name of the Government. He
argued
that the ‘
personal and direct form
’ referring to the President as an individual, needed to be replaced with ‘
impersonal and collective form
’ referring to the collective of the Council of Ministers. In response, another member
pointed out
that the ‘
executive power is co-extensive with the power of the Legislature
’. The President is an important link between the legislature and the executive. He also reminded that in effect, the President cannot act independently but only on the advice of the Cabinet and the Prime Minister. Hence this proposal was unnecessary.
The Assembly did not accept any amendments; and
adopted
the Draft Article on 7 January 1949.
