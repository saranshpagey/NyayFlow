SUMMARY
Draft Article 226 (Article 249, Constitution of India, 1950) was debated on
13 June,1949
. This provision created an exception to the federal structure adopted in the Constitution. It permitted the Union Parliament to make laws on subjects in the state list if authorised by the Council of States (Rajya Sabha) to do so in national interest.
First, some members felt that the Draft Article was not necessary: They
believed
that the States would themselves pass such laws in national interest.
Second, a the Chairman of the Drafting Committee
proposed
an amendment to state that the law passed by the Union Parliament will be valid for one year unless it is extended by the Rajya Sabha. In response to this proposed amendment, some members
urged
that the amendment reduced the impact of the Draft Article by imposing a strict time period. In the end, the Assembly
accepted
the amendment.
Draft Article 226 (as amended) was adopted on
13 June1949
.
Subsequently, Article 249 was amended in
2016
clarifying that the Union Parliament may make laws on goods and services tax under this provision.
