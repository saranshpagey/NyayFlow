Summary
Draft Article 35 (Article 44) was debated on
23 November 1948
. It directed the State to bring about a uniform civil code across India.
The debate around the Draft Article triggered conflict in the Assembly. Most of the opposition to the Draft Article came from Muslim members who moved
amendments
to keep personal laws out of it’s scope. One member
proposed
a proviso that would have operationalised the Draft Article only with the prior assent of the community.
The arguments mobilised to attack the Draft Article included —
first
, that uniform civil code violated freedom of religion;
second
, that it would create disharmony within the Muslim community; and
third,
that it was incorrect to interfere with personal law without the approval of the specific religious communities involved.
A Drafting Committee member defended the provision and
argued
that a uniform civil code was important to uphold the unity of the country, and the Constitution’s secular credentials. He
reminded
Muslims members that this was not a provision that would affect the Muslim community alone – even the Hindu community would be affected. He further
added
that women’s rights could never be secured without a uniform civil code.
At the end of the debate, it was
clarified
that there was nothing new about the uniform civil code: there was already a common civil code in India. The only difference with the new code was that it would cover marriage and inheritance – which were not under the scope of the existing code. It was also
pointed out
that this was a Directive Principle, the State was not obliged to bring the provision into effect immediately and it should only do so when it obtained the consent of all communities,
The Draft Article was
adopted
on the same day, without any amendments.
