SUMMARY
Schedule III-A (Fourth Schedule of the Constitution of India 1950) was not part of the Draft Constitution of India 1948. It was introduced in the Constituent Assembly by a Drafting Committee member on 17 October 1949 and was taken up by the Assembly for discussion only on this day. This Schedule provided the distribution of seats in the Rajya Sabha for each State.
A Drafting Committee member informed the Assembly that the scheme of seat distribution was based on the report of the Union Constitution Committee. He explained to the Assembly the reason for keeping the number of total seats allocated at 205, though Draft Article 67 allowed for a maximum of 250 seats in the Rajya Sabha. Since the merger and break up of States was still not finalized, the Drafting Committee kept the number to 205 anticipating an increase in the total seats allocated to States if they were to split up.
Schedule III-A did not generate much debate and was adopted as part of the Constitution on 17 October 1949.
