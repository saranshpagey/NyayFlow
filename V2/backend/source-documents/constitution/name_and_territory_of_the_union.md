Summary
Draft Article 1 (Article 1 of Constitution of India 1950) was debated on
15
and
17 November 1948
, and
17
and
18 September 1949
. The Draft Article declared India as a ‘
Union of States
’ and went on to define India’s territory.
Most members were
confused
as to why India was described as a ‘
Union of States
’, instead of a ‘
Federation
’ which was more appropriate. While presenting the Draft Constitution on an earlier date, the Drafting Committee Chairman had
explained
that ‘
Union of States
’ was used to ensure and clarify that States did not have the right to secede from India.
A Member
wanted to rename
‘
India
‘ to ‘
Bharat
’ as the latter had more historical pedigree. Another Member
introduced
an amendment to use both ‘
India
’ and ‘
Bharat
’ in the Draft Article. The Drafting Committee Chairman had through an amendment,
suggested
that the Draft Article say ‘
India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States
’. Except for one member who found the phrasing
inelegant
, the amendment won the support of the house.
The Assembly rejected all amendments to the Draft Article except those introduced by Drafting Committee Chairman. It
adopted
the Draft Article on 18 September 1949.
