Version 1
Article 185, Draft Constitution 1948
(1) No discussion shall take place in the Legislature of a State with respect to the conduct of any judge of the Supreme Court or of a High Court in the discharge of his duties.
(2) In this article, the reference to a High Court shall be construed as including a reference to any court in a State for the time being specified in Part III of the First Schedule which is a High Court for any of the purposes of Chapter IV of Part V of this Constitution.
Version 2
Article 211, Constitution of India

Summary
Draft Article 185 (Article 211) was debated on
10 June 1949
. It created restrictions on discussions in the State Legislature on the conduct of members of the Judiciary.
A member of the Drafting Committee
wanted
to delete clause (2). He
pointed
out that this was in continuance of the practice of omitting specific reference to States in Part III of the First Schedule. This amendment was
accepted
without debate.
Some members
raised
an objection to the Draft Article, arguing that it would stifle discussion about any wrongdoing by judges. In response, a member of the Drafting Committee
pointed
out that the Assembly had adopted Draft Article 101 (Article 121) which applied similar restrictions on discussions in Parliament.
The amended Draft Article was
adopted
on 10 June 1949.
