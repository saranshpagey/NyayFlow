Summary
Draft Article 2 (Article 2) was debated on
5
and
17 November 1948
. It empowered Parliament to make laws to admit or establish states to the Union.
One member
believed
that ‘
State
’ should be clearly defined in order to ensure uniform interpretation in the Constitution. He argued that the Draft Constitution in its current form uses ‘
state
’ indiscriminately in myriad forms. However, ‘
State
’ must be defined to always connote ‘
a kind of sovereignty
’. He proposed to retain old expressions such as ‘
Provinces, Indian States and Chief Commissioners’ Provinces
’.
He
argued
that Draft Articles 2 and 3 overlap and moved a proposal to substitute them with a single Article. He opined that the purpose of Draft Article 2 was achieved by Draft Article 3 (Article 3), and having two separate Articles was redundant. However, his amendment was
not accepted
.
The Assembly
adopted
Draft Article 2 without amendments on 17 November 1948.
