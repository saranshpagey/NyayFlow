Upon the completion of each census, the allocation of seats in the House of the People to the States and the division of each State into territorial constituencies shall be readjusted by such authority and in such manner as Parliament may by law determine:
Provided that such readjustment shall not affect representation in the House of the People until the dissolution of the then existing House:
Provided further that such readjustment shall take effect from such date as the President may, by order, specify and until such readjustment takes effect, any election to the House may be held on the basis of the territorial constituencies existing before such readjustment:
Provided also that until the relevant figures for the first census taken after the year 2026 have been published, it shall not be necessary to readjust—
(i) the allocation of seats in the House of the People to the States as readjusted on the basis of the 1971 census; and

Summary
Draft Article 67(8) (Article 82) was debated on
4 January 1949
. It provided for the Parliament to readjust, after completion of each census, seats allocated to the House of the People to the States and division of each State into territorial constituencies.
A member
moved
an amendment to insert ‘
on the basis of population
’ after the word ‘
readjusted
’. He urged that readjustment should be on the basis of population. This amendment was defeated.
Another member
moved
an amendment which proposed to add a proviso to ensure that readjustment would not occur until the dissolution of the existing House. He argued that it would be difficult to readjust existing legislatures and it should begin only after subsequent elections. This amendment was adopted.
The Constituent Assembly
adopted
this article with amendments on 4 January 1949.
