Summary
Draft Article 23(1)-(2) (Article 29) were debated on
7
and
8 December 1948
. It aimed to secure the cultural and educational rights of minorities.
One member
proposed
to amend clause (1) to give minorities the right to ‘
develop
’ their culture. He argued that culture was not static; it was dynamic and progressive, and the Draft Article should reflect the same. This was
rejected
by the Assembly.
Another member
wanted
to limit the scope of the Draft Article only to linguistic minorities. He argued that recognizing special rights for religious minorities would promote communalism. This was in contrast to a
proposal
to expand the Draft Article to cover religious, racial, caste, and linguistic minorities.
The second proposal was
accepted
by the Assembly, and the Draft Article was
adopted
on 8 December 1948.
