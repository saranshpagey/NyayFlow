Summary
Draft Article 203 (Article 224) was debated on
15 June
and
16 October 1949
. It gave the High Courts the power of superintendence over all courts within their jurisdiction.
The Chairman of the Drafting Constitution
proposed
that the heading of the Article be changed to ‘
Power of superintendence over all courts by the High Court
’. In response, a member
argued
that the term ‘
over all courts
’ was redundant. The Assembly
accepted
the Chairman’s amendment.
The amended Draft Article was initially
adopted
on 15 June 1949.
Subsequently, a member of the Drafting Committee
proposed
to add clause (4) to the Draft Article, which clarified that the High Court’s power of superintendence would not extend to any court or tribunal of the Armed Forces. He
stated
that this clause had been introduced at the behest of the Defence Ministry. The amendment was
accepted
without any debate on 16 October 1949.
