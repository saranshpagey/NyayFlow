## Citation
Section 41, Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973

## Full Text
(1) Any police officer may without an order from a Magistrate and without a warrant, arrest any person—
(a) who commits, in the presence of a police officer, a cognizable offence;
(b) against whom a reasonable complaint has been made, or credible information has been received, or a reasonable suspicion exists that he has committed a cognizable offence punishable with imprisonment for a term which may be less than seven years... if the following conditions are satisfied:
   (i) the police officer has reason to believe on the basis of such complaint... that such person has committed the said offence;
   (ii) the police officer is satisfied that such arrest is necessary—
       (a) to prevent such person from committing any further offence; or
       (b) for proper investigation of the offence; or
       (c) to prevent such person from... tampering with evidence; or
       (d) to prevent such person from... inducing witnesses; or
       (e) ensuring his presence in court.
[...continues with other grounds like proclaimed offender, possession of stolen property, obstruction of police, etc...]

## Key Provisions
- **Cognizable Offenses**: Police can arrest without warrant for serious offenses (e.g., murder, rape, theft).
- **Offenses < 7 Years**: Arrest is NOT automatic. Police must verify necessity (Arnesh Kumar guidelines).
- **Proclaimed Offender**: Can be arrested without warrant.
- **Stolen Property**: Possession of suspected stolen property allows arrest.

## Section 41A - Notice of Appearance
Inserted in 2010. If arrest is not required under Section 41(1), the police officer **shall** issue a notice directing the person to appear. If the person complies, they shall not be arrested unless recorded reasons exist.

## Landmark Guidelines

### Arnesh Kumar v. State of Bihar (2014)
**Citation**: (2014) 8 SCC 273
To prevent arbitrary arrests, the Supreme Court mandated:
1. No automatic arrest for offenses with < 7 years punishment.
2. Police must check Section 41(1)(b) checklist (necessity of arrest).
3. Magistrate must check the checklist before authorizing detention.
4. Notice under Section 41A should be the norm for lesser offenses.

### D.K. Basu v. State of West Bengal (1997)
**Citation**: AIR 1997 SC 610
Laid down requirements for arrest:
- Police must wear visible identification.
- Arrest memo must be prepared.
- Family/friend must be informed of arrest.
- Medical examination of arrestee.
- Right to lawyer.

## Practical Checklist for Arrest
Before arresting, a police officer must ask:
1. Is it a cognizable offense?
2. Is the punishment > 7 years? (If yes, can arrest).
3. If < 7 years, is arrest necessary to prevent tampering, flight, or new crimes? (If no, issue Notice 41A).

## Rights of Arrested Person
- To know grounds of arrest (Section 50).
- To inform a nominated person (Section 50A).
- To have a lawyer (Section 41D).
- To be produced before Magistrate within 24 hours (Section 57).
- To be medically examined (Section 54).
