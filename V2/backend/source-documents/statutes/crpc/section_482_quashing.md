# Section 482 CrPC - Saving of Inherent Powers of High Court

## Citation
Section 482, Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973

## Full Text
Nothing in this Code shall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent powers of the High Court to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under this Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice.

## Purpose and Scope
This section preserves the **inherent power** of the High Court. It doesn't confer new power but recognizes existing power to:
1. Give effect to orders under CrPC.
2. Prevent abuse of process of any court.
3. Secure the ends of justice.

It is a "Saving Clause".

## Key Uses (Quashing)
The most common use of Section 482 is to **quash criminal proceedings/FIRs** when:
- The case is civil in nature but painted as criminal.
- The allegations are absurd or totally lacking evidence.
- The parties have compromised (in non-heinous offenses).
- The prosecution is malicious.

## Landmark Guidelines

### State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal (1992)
**Citation**: 1992 Supp (1) SCC 335
Seven categories for quashing:
1. Allegations in FIR don't constitute any offense.
2. Allegations are so absurd that no prudent person can believe them.
3. No cognizable offense disclosed (no investigation allowed).
4. Evidence collected doesn't support the charge.
5. Legal bar to the proceedings (e.g., lack of sanction).
6. Malicious prosecution (personal vendetta).

### Gian Singh v. State of Punjab (2012)
**Citation**: (2012) 10 SCC 303
Held that High Court can quash FIRs in non-compoundable offenses if the dispute is private/matrimonial and parties have settled, provided it is not a heinous crime (rape, murder, dacoity).

### Parbatbhai Aahir v. State of Gujarat (2017)
**Citation**: (2017) 9 SCC 641
Summarized principles: Quashing is not a right but a discretionary power. It should be used sparingly. Economic offenses and heinous crimes cannot be quashed even on settlement.

## Limitations
- Cannot be used if there is a specific provision in the Code for redress (e.g., appeal).
- Court cannot conduct a mini-trial or appreciate evidence at this stage.
- Should be exercised "sparingly, carefully, and with caution".

## Comparison with Article 226
- **Section 482 CrPC**: Statutory inherent power restricted to criminal matters.
- **Article 226 Constitution**: Constitutional writ jurisdiction (wider scope).
- Often petitions are filed as "Criminal Writ Petition under Art 226 r/w Section 482 CrPC".

## Practical Notes
- **Filing**: Filed in the High Court.
- **Stay**: High Court can stay the investigation or trial proceedings while deciding the 482 petition.
- **Timing**: Can be filed at any stage (after FIR, after charge-sheet, specific orders).
