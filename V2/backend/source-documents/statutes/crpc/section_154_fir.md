# Section 154 CrPC - Information in Cognizable Cases (FIR)

## Citation
Section 154, Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973

## Full Text
(1) Every information relating to the commission of a cognizable offence, if given orally to an officer in charge of a police station, shall be reduced to writing by him or under his direction, and be read over to the informant; and every such information... shall be signed by the person giving it, and the substance thereof shall be entered in a book...
(2) A copy of the information as recorded... shall be given forthwith, free of cost, to the informant.
(3) Any person aggrieved by a refusal... may send the substance of such information... to the Superintendent of Police...

## Key Aspects
1. **Mandatory Registration**: If information discloses a cognizable offense, police MUST register FIR.
2. **Written Record**: Oral information must be written down.
3. **Read Over**: Must be read to the informant to verify accuracy.
4. **Signature**: Informant must sign it.
5. **Free Copy**: Informant holds a right to get a free copy immediately.

## Zero FIR
- FIR can be registered at **any** police station, irrespective of jurisdiction.
- It is then transferred to the appropriate station.
- Crucial for cases like rape or murder where immediate action is needed.

## Landmark Cases

### Lalita Kumari v. Govt. of U.P. (2014)
**Citation**: (2014) 2 SCC 1
Constitution Bench held:
- Registration of FIR is **mandatory** under Section 154 if information discloses commission of a cognizable offense.
- No preliminary inquiry is permissible in such situations.
- Preliminary inquiry is allowed ONLY to ascertain if a cognizable offense is disclosed (e.g., in matrimonial disputes, commercial offenses, medical negligence, corruption cases).
- Preliminary inquiry must be completed within 7 days.

### State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal (1992)
**Citation**: 1992 Supp (1) SCC 335
Valid grounds for quashing FIR (under Section 482):
- Allegations do not constitute any offense.
- Allegations are absurd or inherently improbable.
- Malafide intention or vengeance.

## Remedies for Non-Registration
If Station House Officer (SHO) refuses to register FIR:
1. **Section 154(3)**: Send written complaint to Superintendent of Police (SP).
2. **Section 156(3)**: Application to Magistrate to direct investigation.
3. **Writ Petition**: Approach High Court under Article 226.

## Practical Notes
- **Informant**: Can be anyone (victim, witness, or anyone with knowledge).
- **Delay**: Delay in filing FIR must be explained, as it can cast doubt on the prosecution's case.
- **Telephone**: Crypto information via phone/email can be treated as FIR if clear and definite.
