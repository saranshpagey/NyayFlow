# Section 161 CrPC - Examination of Witnesses by Police

## Citation
Section 161, Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973

## Full Text
(1) Any police officer making an investigation... may examine orally any person supposed to be acquainted with the facts and circumstances of the case.
(2) Such person shall be bound to answer truly all questions relating to such case put to him by such officer, other than questions the answers to which would have a tendency to expose him to a criminal charge or to a penalty or forfeiture.
(3) The police officer may reduce into writing any statement made to him in the course of an examination under this section; and if he does so, he shall make a separate and true record of the statement of each such person whose statement he records.

## Key Provisions
1. **Power to Examine**: Police can question anyone familiar with case facts.
2. **Duty to Answer**: Witness MUST answer truly.
3. **Right Against Self-Incrimination**: Witness can refuse to answer questions that incriminate them (Article 20(3) of Constitution).
4. **Recording**: Police *may* write it down (Case Diary).
5. **No Signature**: The witness is NOT required to sign the statement (per Section 162 CrPC).

## Evidentiary Value (Section 162 CrPC)
- A statement to police under Section 161 is **NOT substantive evidence**.
- It **cannot** be used to prove the guilt of the accused directly.
- **Uses**:
  - **Contradiction**: Defense can use it to contradict the witness in court (under Section 145 Evidence Act).
  - **Re-examination**: Prosecution can use it to explain contradictions (with court's permission).
  - It cannot be used for corroboration.

## Audio-Video Recording
Proviso to Section 161(3) (added in 2008): Statement of a woman victim in certain offenses (rape, etc.) may be recorded by audio-video means.

## Comparison: Section 161 vs. Section 164
| Feature | Section 161 | Section 164 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Recorded By** | Police Officer | Judicial Magistrate |
| **Oath** | No Oath | On Oath (for witnesses) |
| **Signature** | Not Signed | Signed by Witness/Accused |
| **Value** | Not substantive; Contradiction only | Substantive (Corroboration & Contradiction) |
| **Admissibility** | Weak Evidence | Strong Evidence |

## Landmark Cases

### Nandini Satpathy v. P.L. Dani (1978)
**Citation**: AIR 1978 SC 1025
Held that the right against self-incrimination (Article 20(3)) applies to police interrogations under Section 161. An accused/witness has the right to remain silent if the answer exposes them to guilt.

## Practical Notes
- Police often record 161 statements to fix the prosecution version.
- Discrepancies between 161 statement and court testimony are the primary tool for defense lawyers to destroy a witness's credibility.
