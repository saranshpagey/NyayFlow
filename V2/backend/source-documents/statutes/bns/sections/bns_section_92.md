Whoever does any act under such circumstances, that if he thereby caused death
he would be guilty of culpable homicide, and does by such act cause the death of a quick
unborn child, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may
extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.
Illustration.
A, knowing that he is likely to cause the death of a pregnant woman, does an act
which, if it caused the death of the woman, would amount to culpable homicide. The woman
is injured, but does not die; but the death of an unborn quick child with which she is
pregnant is thereby caused. A is guilty of the offence defined in this section.
