Illustration.
A institutes a suit against Z. Z, knowing that A is likely to obtain a decree against
him, fraudulently suffers a judgment to pass against him for a larger amount at the suit of
B, who has no just claim against him, in order that B, either on his own account or for the
benefit of Z, may share in the proceeds of any sale of Z’s property which may be made
under A’s decree. Z has committed an offence under this section.
