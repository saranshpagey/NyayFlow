Illustrations.
(a) Z is sitting in a moored boat on a river. A unfastens the moorings, and thus
intentionally causes the boat to drift down the stream. Here A intentionally causes motion to
Z, and he does this by disposing substances in such a manner that the motion is produced
without any other action on any person’s part. A has therefore intentionally used force to Z;
and if he has done so without Z’s consent, in order to the committing of any offence, or
intending or knowing it to be likely that this use of force will cause injury, fear or annoyance
to Z, A has used criminal force to Z.
(b) Z is riding in a chariot. A lashes Z’s horses, and thereby causes them to quicken
their pace. HereA has caused change of motion to Z by inducing the animals to change their
motion. A has therefore used force to Z; and ifA has done this without Z’s consent, intending
or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z,A has used criminal
force to Z.
(c) Z is riding in a palanquin. A, intending to rob Z, seizes the pole and stops the
palanquin. Here A has caused cessation of motion to Z, and he has done this by his own
bodily power. A has therefore used force to Z; and as A has acted thus intentionally, without
Z’s consent, in order to the commission of an offence. A has used criminal force to Z.
(d) A intentionally pushes against Z in the street. Here A has by his own bodily power
moved his own person so as to bring it into contact with Z. He has therefore intentionally
used force to Z; and if he has done so without Z’s consent, intending or knowing it to be
likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force to Z.
(e) A throws a stone, intending or knowing it to be likely that the stone will be thus
brought into contact with Z, or with Z’s clothes, or with something carried by Z, or that it will
strike water and dash up the water against Z’s clothes or something carried by Z. Here, if the
throwing of the stone produce the effect of causing any substance to come into contact with
Z, or Z’s clothes, A has used force to Z, and if he did so without Z’s consent, intending
thereby to injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force to Z.
(f)A intentionally pulls up a woman’s veil. HereA intentionally uses force to her, and if
he does so without her consent intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby
injure, frighten or annoy her, he has used criminal force to her.
(g) Z is bathing. A pours into the bath water which he knows to be boiling. Here A
intentionally by his own bodily power causes such motion in the boiling water as brings that
water into contact with Z, or with other water so situated that such contact must affect Z’s
sense of feeling; A has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done this
without Z’s consent intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause injury,
fear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force.
(h) A incites a dog to spring upon Z, without Z’s consent. Here, if A intends to cause
