Whoever at an election applies for a voting paper on votes in the name of any
other person, whether living or dead, or in a fictitious name, or who having voted once at
such election applies at the same election for a voting paper in his own name, and whoever
abets, procures or attempts to procure the voting by any person in any such way, commits
the offence of personation at an election:
Provided that nothing in this section shall apply to a person who has been authorised
to vote as proxy for an elector under any law for the time being in force in so far as he votes
as a proxy for such elector.
