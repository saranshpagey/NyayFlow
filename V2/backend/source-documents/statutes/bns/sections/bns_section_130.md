Whoever makes any gesture, or any preparation intending or knowing it to be

who makes that gesture or preparation is about to use criminal force to that person, is said to

Criminal force.
Assault.
Sec. 1] THE GAZETTE OF INDIA EXTRAORDINAR Y 43_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Explanation.—Mere words do not amount to an assault. But the words which a
person uses may give to his gestures or preparation such a meaning as may make those
gestures or preparations amount to an assault.
Illustrations.
(a)Ashakes his fist at Z, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause
Z to believe that A is about to strike Z. A has committed an assault.
(b) A begins to unloose the muzzle of a ferocious dog, intending or knowing it to be
likely that he may thereby cause Z to believe that he is about to cause the dog to attack Z. A
has committed an assault upon Z.
(c) A takes up a stick, saying to Z, “I will give you a beating”. Here, though the words
used by Acould in no case amount to an assault, and though the mere gesture, unaccompanied
by any other circumstances, might not amount to an assault, the gesture explained by the
words may amount to an assault.
