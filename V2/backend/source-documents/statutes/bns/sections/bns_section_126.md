proceeding in any direction in which that person has a right to proceed, is said wrongfully to
restrain that person.

good faith believes himself to have a lawful right to obstruct, is not an offence within the

Illustration.
A obstructs a path along which Z has a right to pass, A not believing in good faith that
he has a right to stop the path. Z is thereby prevented from passing. A wrongfully
restrains Z.

imprisonment for a term which may extend to one month, or with fine which may extend to
five thousand rupees, or with both.
