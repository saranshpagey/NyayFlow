Whoever intending to facilitate or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby
facilitate the commission of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life,
voluntarily conceals by any act or omission, or by the use of encryption or any other
information hiding tool, the existence of a design to commit such offence or makes any
representation which he knows to be false respecting such design shall,––
(a) if that offence be committed, be punished with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to seven years; or
(b) if the offence be not committed, with imprisonment of either description, for
a term which may extend to three years,
and shall also be liable to fine.
Illustration.
A, knowing that dacoity is about to be committed at B, falsely informs the Magistrate
that a dacoity is about to be committed at C, a place in an opposite direction, and thereby
misleads the Magistrate with intent to facilitate the commission of the offence. The dacoity
is committed at B in pursuance of the design. A is punishable under this section.
