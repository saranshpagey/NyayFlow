Whoever abets the commission of an offence punishable with death or
imprisonment for life, shall, if that offence be not committed in consequence of the abetment,
and no express provision is made under this Sanhita for the punishment of such abetment, be
punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven
years, and shall also be liable to fine; and if any act for which the abettor is liable in consequence
of the abetment, and which causes hurt to any person, is done, the abettor shall be liable to
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to fourteen years, and shall
also be liable to fine.
Illustration.
A instigates B to murder Z. The offence is not committed. If B had murdered Z, he
would have been subject to the punishment of death or imprisonment for life. Therefore, Ais
liable to imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years and also to a fine; and if
any hurt be done to Z in consequence of the abetment, he will be liable to imprisonment for
a term which may extend to fourteen years, and to fine.
