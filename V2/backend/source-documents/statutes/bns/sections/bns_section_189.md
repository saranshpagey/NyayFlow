(d) by means of criminal force, or show of criminal force, to any person, to take or
obtain possession of any property, or to deprive any person of the enjoyment of a
right of way, or of the use of water or other incorporeal right of which he is in possession
or enjoyment, or to enforce any right or supposed right; or
(e) by means of criminal force, or show of criminal force, to compel any person to
do what he is not legally bound to do, or to omit to do what he is legally entitled to do.
