or otherwise, alters a document or an electronic record in any material part thereof,
after it has been made, executed or affixed with electronic signature either by himself or
by any other person, whether such person be living or dead at the time of such
alteration; or
(C) Who dishonestly or fraudulently causes any person to sign, seal, execute or
alter a document or an electronic record or to affix his electronic signature on any

Illustrations.
(a)Ahas a letter of credit upon B for rupees 10,000, written by Z. A, in order to defraud
B, adds cipher to the 10,000, and makes the sum 1,00,000 intending that it may be believed by
B that Z so wrote the letter. A has committed forgery.
(b)A, without Z’s authority, affixes Z’s seal to a document purporting to be a conveyance
of an estate from Z to A, with the intention of selling the estate to B and thereby of obtaining
from B the purchase-money. Ahas committed forgery.
(c) A picks up a cheque on a banker signed by B, payable to bearer, but without any
sum having been inserted in the cheque. A fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the
sum of ten thousand rupees. A commits forgery.
(d)A leaves with B, his agent, a cheque on a banker, signed byA, without inserting the
sum payable and authorises B to fill up the cheque by inserting a sum not exceeding ten
thousand rupees for the purpose of making certain payments. B fraudulently fills up the
cheque by inserting the sum of twenty thousand rupees. B commits forgery.
(e) A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B without B’s authority,
intending to discount it as a genuine bill with a banker and intending to take up the bill on its
maturity. Here, as A draws the bill with intent to deceive the banker by leading him to
suppose that he had the security of B, and thereby to discount the bill, A is guilty of forgery.
(f) Z’s will contains these words—“I direct that all my remaining property be equally
divided between A, B and C”.A dishonestly scratches out B’s name, intending that it may be
believed that the whole was left to himself and C. A has committed forgery.
(g) A endorses a Government promissory note and makes it payable to Z or his order
by writing on the bill the words “Pay to Z or his order” and signing the endorsement. B
dishonestly erases the words “Pay to Z or his order”, and thereby converts the special
endorsement into a blank endorsement. B commits forgery.
(h) Asells and conveys an estate to Z. Aafterwards, in order to defraud Z of his estate,
executes a conveyance of the same estate to B, dated six months earlier than the date of the
conveyance to Z, intending it to be believed that he had conveyed the estate to B before he
conveyed it to Z. A has committed forgery.
(i) Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a different legatee from the
legatee named by Z, and by representing to Z that he has prepared the will according to his
instructions, induces Z to sign the will. A has committed forgery.
(j) Awrites a letter and signs it with B’s name without B’s authority, certifying that A is
a man of good character and in distressed circumstances from unforeseen misfortune,
intending by means of such letter to obtain alms from Z and other persons. Here, as A made
a false document in order to induce Z to part with property, A has committed forgery.

(k) A without B’s authority writes a letter and signs it in B’s name certifying to A’s
character, intending thereby to obtain employment under Z. A has committed forgery in as
much as he intended to deceive Z by the forged certificate, and thereby to induce Z to enter
into an express or implied contract for service.
Explanation 1.—A man’s signature of his own name may amount to forgery.
Illustrations.
(a) A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be believed that
the bill was drawn by another person of the same name. A has committed forgery.
(b) A writes the word “accepted” on a piece of paper and signs it with Z’s name, in
order that B may afterwards write on the paper a bill of exchange drawn by B upon Z, and
negotiate the bill as though it had been accepted by Z. A is guilty of forgery; and if B,
knowing the fact, draws the bill upon the paper pursuant to A’s intention, B is also guilty of
forgery.
(c) A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the same
name. A endorses the bill in his own name, intending to cause it to be believed that it was
endorsed by the person to whose order it was payable; here A has committed forgery.
(d) A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against B. B, after the
seizure of the estate, in collusion with Z, executes a lease of the estate, to Z at a nominal rent
and for a long period and dates the lease six months prior to the seizure, with intent to
defraud A, and to cause it to be believed that the lease was granted before the seizure. B,
though he executes the lease in his own name, commits forgery by antedating it.
(e) A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for A’s benefit, and
with intent to defraud his creditors; and in order to give a colour to the transaction, writes a
promissory note binding himself to pay to B a sum for value received, and antedates the
note, intending that it may be believed to have been made before A was on the point of
insolvency. A has committed forgery under the first head of the definition.
Explanation 2.—The making of a false document in the name of a fictitious person,
intending it to be believed that the document was made by a real person, or in the name of a
deceased person, intending it to be believed that the document was made by the person in
his lifetime, may amount to forgery.
Illustration.
A draws a bill of exchange upon a fictitious person, and fraudulently accepts the bill in
the name of such fictitious person with intent to negotiate it. A commits forgery.
Explanation 3.—For the purposes of this section, the expression “affixing electronic
signature” shall have the meaning assigned to it in clause (d) of sub-section (1) of section 2
of the Information Technology Act, 2000.
