Whoever fraudulently accepts, receives or claims any property or any interest
therein, knowing that he has no right or rightful claim to such property or interest, or
practises any deception touching any right to any property or any interest therein,
intending thereby to prevent that property or interest therein from being taken as a forfeiture
or in satisfaction of a fine, under a sentence which has been pronounced, or which he
knows to be likely to be pronounced by a Court or other competent authority, or from
being taken in execution of a decree or order which has been made, or which he knows to
be likely to be made by a Court in a civil suit, shall be punished with imprisonment of
either description for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.
