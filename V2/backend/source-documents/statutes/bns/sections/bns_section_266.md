Whoever, having accepted any conditional remission of punishment, knowingly
violates any condition on which such remission was granted, shall be punished with the
punishment to which he was originally sentenced, if he has already suffered no part of that
punishment, and if he has suffered any part of that punishment, then with so much of that
punishment as he has not already suffered.
