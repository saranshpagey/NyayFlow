Whoever sells, lets to hire, or otherwise disposes of any child with intent that such
child shall at any age be employed or used for the purpose of prostitution or illicit intercourse
with any person or for any unlawful and immoral purpose, or knowing it to be likely that such
child will at any age be employed or used for any such purpose, shall be punished with
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be
liable to fine.
Explanation 1.—When a female under the age of eighteen years is sold, let for hire, or
otherwise disposed of to a prostitute or to any person who keeps or manages a brothel, the
person so disposing of such female shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have
disposed of her with the intent that she shall be used for the purpose of prostitution.
Explanation 2.—For the purposes of this section “illicit intercourse” means sexual
intercourse between persons not united by marriage or by any union or tie which, though
not amounting to a marriage, is recognised by the personal law or custom of the community
to which they belong or, where they belong to different communities, of both such
communities, as constituting between them aquasi-marital relation.
