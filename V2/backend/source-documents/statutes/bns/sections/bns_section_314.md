Illustrations.
(a) A takes property belonging to Z out of Z’s possession, in good faith believing at
the time when he takes it, that the property belongs to himself. A is not guilty of theft; but if
A, after discovering his mistake, dishonestly appropriates the property to his own use, he is
guilty of an offence under this section.
(b) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z’s library in Z’s absence, and takes
away a book without Z’s express consent. Here, if Awas under the impression that he had Z’s
implied consent to take the book for the purpose of reading it, Ahas not committed theft. But,
ifA afterwards sells the book for his own benefit, he is guilty of an offence under this section.
(c) A and B, being, joint owners of a horse. A takes the horse out of B’s possession,
intending to use it. Here, as A has a right to use the horse, he does not dishonestly
misappropriate it. But, if A sells the horse and appropriates the whole proceeds to his own
use, he is guilty of an offence under this section.
Explanation 1.—A dishonest misappropriation for a time only is a misappropriation
within the meaning of this section.
Illustration.
A finds a Government promissory note belonging to Z, bearing a blank endorsement.
A, knowing that the note belongs to Z, pledges it with a banker as a security for a loan,
intending at a future time to restore it to Z. A has committed an offence under this section.
Explanation 2.—A person who finds property not in the possession of any other
person, and takes such property for the purpose of protecting it for, or of restoring it to, the
owner, does not take or misappropriate it dishonestly, and is not guilty of an offence; but he
is guilty of the offence above defined, if he appropriates it to his own use, when he knows or
has the means of discovering the owner, or before he has used reasonable means to discover
and give notice to the owner and has kept the property a reasonable time to enable the owner
to claim it.
What are reasonable means or what is a reasonable time in such a case, is a question
of fact.
It is not necessary that the finder should know who is the owner of the property, or that
any particular person is the owner of it; it is sufficient if, at the time of appropriating it, he
does not believe it to be his own property, or in good faith believe that the real owner cannot
be found.
Illustrations.
(a) A finds a rupee on the high road, not knowing to whom the rupee belongs, A picks
