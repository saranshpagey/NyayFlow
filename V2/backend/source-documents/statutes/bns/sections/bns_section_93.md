having the care of such child, shall expose or leave such child in any place with the intention
of wholly abandoning such child, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description
for a term which may extend to seven years, or with fine, or with both.

murder or culpable homicide, as the case may be, if the child die in consequence of the
exposure.
