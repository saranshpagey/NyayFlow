(1) Kidnapping is of two kinds: kidnapping from India, and kidnapping from
lawful guardianship––
(a) whoever conveys any person beyond the limits of India without the consent
of that person, or of some person legally authorised to consent on behalf of that
person, is said to kidnap that person from India;
(b) whoever takes or entices any child or any person of unsound mind, out of the
keeping of the lawful guardian of such child or person of unsound mind, without the
consent of such guardian, is said to kidnap such child or person from lawful
guardianship.
Explanation.––The words “lawful guardian” in this clause include any person
lawfully entrusted with the care or custody of such child or other person.
Exception.—This clause does not extend to the act of any person who in good
faith believes himself to be the father of an illegitimate child, or who in good faith
believes himself to be entitled to the lawful custody of such child, unless such act is
committed for an immoral or unlawful purpose.
(2) Whoever kidnaps any person from India or from lawful guardianship shall be
punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven
years, and shall also be liable to fine.
