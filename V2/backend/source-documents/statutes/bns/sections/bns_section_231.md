Whoever gives or fabricates false evidence intending thereby to cause, or
knowing it to be likely that he will thereby cause, any person to be convicted of an
offence which by the law for the time being in force in India is not capital, but punishable
with imprisonment for life, or imprisonment for a term of seven years or upwards, shall be
punished as a person convicted of that offence would be liable to be punished.
Illustration.
A gives false evidence before a Court, intending thereby to cause Z to be convicted
of a dacoity. The punishment of dacoity is imprisonment for life, or rigorous imprisonment
for a term which may extend to ten years, with or without fine. A, therefore, is liable to
imprisonment for life or imprisonment, with or without fine.
