Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, is, by
reason of intoxication, incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is
either wrong, or contrary to law; provided that the thing which intoxicated him was
administered to him without his knowledge or against his will.
