# Section 302 IPC - Punishment for Murder

## Citation
Section 302, Indian Penal Code, 1860

## Full Text
Whoever commits murder shall be punished with death, or imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to fine.

## Essential Ingredients
To establish murder under Section 302, the prosecution must prove:
1. **Death of a human being**: The victim must have died
2. **Caused by the accused**: The death was caused by the act of the accused
3. **Intention or Knowledge**: The act was done with:
   - Intention of causing death, OR
   - Intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, OR
   - Knowledge that the act is likely to cause death

## Definition of Murder (Section 300 IPC)
Murder is culpable homicide with specific aggravating circumstances:
1. Act done with **intention of causing death**
2. Act done with **intention of causing bodily injury** that the offender knows is likely to cause death
3. Act done with **intention of causing bodily injury** sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death
4. Act done with **knowledge** that it is so imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause death

## Punishment
- **Death Penalty**: In the "rarest of rare" cases (Bachan Singh doctrine)
- **Life Imprisonment**: Imprisonment for the remainder of natural life
- **Fine**: May be imposed in addition to imprisonment
- **Nature**: Cognizable, non-bailable, non-compoundable offense
- **Triable by**: Court of Session only

## Distinction from Culpable Homicide (Section 304)

### Culpable Homicide Not Amounting to Murder
Under Section 300 IPC, culpable homicide is NOT murder in these exceptions:
1. **Grave and Sudden Provocation** (Exception 1)
2. **Private Defense** exceeding the right (Exception 2)
3. **Public Servant** exceeding lawful powers (Exception 3)
4. **Sudden Fight** without premeditation (Exception 4)
5. **Consent** of the deceased (Exception 5)

### Key Difference
- **Murder (Section 302)**: Intention to cause death or knowledge that act will almost certainly cause death
- **Culpable Homicide (Section 304)**: Intention to cause injury likely to cause death, but without certainty

## Death Penalty - "Rarest of Rare" Doctrine

### Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab (1980)
**Citation**: AIR 1980 SC 898

The Supreme Court laid down the "rarest of rare" doctrine:
- Death penalty should be imposed only in the rarest of rare cases
- Life imprisonment is the rule; death penalty is the exception
- Court must consider both aggravating and mitigating circumstances

### Aggravating Circumstances
- Extreme brutality or depravity
- Murder of a child, woman, or helpless person
- Murder for ransom or in course of dacoity
- Multiple murders
- Murder of a public servant on duty
- Anti-social or socially abhorrent nature

### Mitigating Circumstances
- Age of the accused (young or old)
- Mental state or emotional disturbance
- Probability of reformation
- Provocation or circumstances leading to the act
- No prior criminal record

## Key Judicial Interpretations

### Virsa Singh v. State of Punjab (1958)
**Citation**: AIR 1958 SC 465

Established the test for Section 300 "thirdly":
- Identify the bodily injury inflicted
- Determine if the injury was intended
- Assess if the injury is sufficient in ordinary course to cause death
- All three must be proved for conviction under Section 302

### K.M. Nanavati v. State of Maharashtra (1962)
**Citation**: AIR 1962 SC 605

Famous case involving grave and sudden provocation. Held that:
- Provocation must be grave and sudden
- Accused must act before cooling time
- Retaliation must be proportionate
- Established principles for Exception 1 to Section 300

### Machhi Singh v. State of Punjab (1983)
**Citation**: AIR 1983 SC 957

Refined the "rarest of rare" doctrine with specific categories:
1. Manner of commission of murder (brutal, diabolical)
2. Motive for commission (anti-social, abhorrent)
3. Personality of victim (child, helpless person, public figure)
4. Magnitude of crime (multiple murders, mass killing)

## Landmark Cases

### Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab (1980)
**Citation**: AIR 1980 SC 898

Established the constitutional validity of death penalty and laid down the "rarest of rare" doctrine that governs capital punishment in India.

### Shatrughan Chauhan v. Union of India (2014)
**Citation**: (2014) 3 SCC 1

Held that prolonged delay in execution of death sentence can be a ground for commutation to life imprisonment. Emphasized the mental agony caused by uncertainty.

### Mukesh v. State (NCR of Delhi) (2017)
**Citation**: (2017) 6 SCC 1

Nirbhaya case - Upheld death penalty for all four convicts. Held that the case fell in the "rarest of rare" category due to extreme brutality and social impact.

## Investigation and Trial
- **FIR**: Must be registered immediately (cognizable offense)
- **Investigation**: Typically by senior police officers; CBI in sensitive cases
- **Arrest**: Police can arrest without warrant
- **Bail**: Not available as a matter of right (non-bailable)
- **Trial**: Only by Court of Session
- **Appeal**: Automatic appeal to High Court in death penalty cases
- **Confirmation**: Death sentence must be confirmed by High Court

## Burden of Proof
- Prosecution must prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt
- Circumstantial evidence must form a complete chain
- Benefit of doubt goes to the accused
- In death penalty cases, even stricter scrutiny applied

## Common Defenses
1. **Alibi**: Accused was elsewhere when murder occurred
2. **Self-Defense**: Act was in private defense (Section 96-106 IPC)
3. **Provocation**: Grave and sudden provocation (Exception 1 to Section 300)
4. **Accident**: Death was accidental, not intentional (Section 80 IPC)
5. **Insanity**: Accused was of unsound mind (Section 84 IPC)
6. **Sudden Fight**: Death occurred in sudden fight without premeditation (Exception 4)

## Sentencing Considerations
Courts must consider:
- Nature and gravity of the crime
- Circumstances in which crime was committed
- Age, character, and antecedents of the accused
- Probability of reformation
- Impact on society
- Victim impact statement

## Recent Developments
The Supreme Court has increasingly emphasized:
- Life imprisonment as the norm
- Death penalty only in exceptional cases
- Consideration of socio-economic background
- Mental health and reformation potential
- Delay in execution as grounds for commutation

## Practical Notes
Section 302 IPC is the most serious provision in the Indian Penal Code. Given the irreversible nature of death penalty, courts apply the highest standards of proof and scrutiny. The trend in recent years has been towards restricting the death penalty to the most exceptional cases while ensuring that justice is served.
