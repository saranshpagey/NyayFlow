## Key Judicial Interpretations

### Rupan Deol Bajaj v. K.P.S. Gill (1995)
**Citation**: AIR 1996 SC 309
The Supreme Court defined "modesty" as the essence of a woman's womanhood. The ultimate test is whether the action of the offender is such that it would be perceived as an insult to the modesty of the woman.

### State of Punjab v. Major Singh (1966)
**Citation**: AIR 1967 SC 63
Held that even a child or an infant has modesty that can be outraged. The reaction of the woman is not the sole test; the intention of the offender is key.

### Tarkeshwar Sahu v. State of Bihar (2006)
Held that Section 354 applies even if the act does not amount to rape or attempt to rape, provided the intention to outrage modesty is present.

## Distinction from Rape (Attempt)
- **Section 354**: Outraging modesty (lesser offense).
- **Section 376/511**: Attempt to commit rape (requires determination to commit rape at all costs).
The distinction lies in the degree of determination and the specific nature of the act.

## Practical Notes
- **Subjective Element**: "Modesty" is not defined in IPC but interpreted by courts based on societal standards.
- **Gender Neutrality**: While the victim must be a woman, the perpetrator can be a man or a woman.
- **Reporting**: Can be reported at any police station.
