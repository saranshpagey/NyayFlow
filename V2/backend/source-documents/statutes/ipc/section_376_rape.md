## Key Judicial Interpretations

### Mukesh & Anr v. State for NCT of Delhi (2017)
**Citation**: (2017) 6 SCC 1
(Nirbhaya Case)
The Supreme Court upheld the death penalty, emphasizing the "rarest of rare" doctrine due to the brutal nature of the crime and its impact on society's collective conscience.

### State of Punjab v. Gurmit Singh (1996)
**Citation**: AIR 1996 SC 1393
Held that the testimony of the prosecutrix (victim) does not require corroboration if it is inspiring confidence. The court should not look for corroboration as a rule of law.

### Independent Thought v. Union of India (2017)
**Citation**: (2017) 10 SCC 800
Read down Exception 2 to Section 375, holding that sex with a wife who is under 18 years is rape, regardless of marriage.

## Amendments
- **2013 Amendment**: Following the Nirbhaya case, expanded definition of rape beyond penile-vaginal penetration; introduced death penalty for repeat offenders or if victim enters vegetative state.
- **2018 Amendment**: Following Kathua/Unnao cases, introduced death penalty for rape of girls under 12; increased minimum sentences.

## Investigation Guidelines
- **FIR**: Must be registered immediately (Zero FIR concept applicable).
- **Medical Exam**: Must be conducted within 24 hours (Section 164A CrPC).
- **Statement**: Statement under Section 164 CrPC before Magistrate is mandatory.
- **Identity**: Identity of the victim must be protected (Section 228A IPC).
- **Two-Finger Test**: Banned and unconstitutional (Lillu v. State of Haryana).

## Practical Notes
- **Consent**: Must be unequivocal voluntary agreement. Silence or lack of resistance is NOT consent.
- **Presumption**: Under Section 114A Evidence Act, if victim states she did not consent, court shall presume she did not.
- **Trial**: Must be completed within 2 months (Section 309 CrPC).
