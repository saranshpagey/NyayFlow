# Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala

## Citation
(1973) 4 SCC 225; AIR 1973 SC 1461

## Overview
This is arguably the most significant case in Indian constitutional history. A 13-judge bench (largest ever) sat for 68 days to determine the extent of Parliament's power to amend the Constitution.

The case established the **"Basic Structure Doctrine"** - limiting Parliament's amendment power.

## Core Issue
Can the Parliament amend ANY part of the Constitution, including Fundamental Rights, under Article 368?
- **Government's View**: Yes, Article 368 confers unlimited power.
- **Petitioner's View**: No, there are implied limitations; essential features cannot be destroyed.

## The Judgment (7:6 Split)
By a razor-thin majority of 7:6, the Supreme Court held:
1. **Power to Amend**: Parliament has wide powers to amend the Constitution, INCLUDING Fundamental Rights.
2. **Limitation**: This power is NOT unlimited. It cannot be used to damage or destroy the **"Basic Structure"** or basic framework of the Constitution.
3. **Golaknath Overruled**: The previous ruling in *Golaknath v. State of Punjab* (1967), which said Fundamental Rights are unamendable, was overruled.
4. **24th Amendment Valid**: Upheld the 24th Amendment which affirmed Parliament's power to amend any part.

## What is the "Basic Structure"?
The Court did not give an exhaustive list, but judges gave illustrative examples:
- Supremacy of the Constitution
- Republican and Democratic form of government
- Secular character of the Constitution
- Separation of powers (Legislature, Executive, Judiciary)
- Federal character of the Constitution
- Sovereignty and integrity of India
- Rule of Law
- Judicial Review
- Dignity of the individual

(Later added: Free and fair elections, Independence of Judiciary).

## Key Opinions
- **Justice H.R. Khanna** (The Deciding Vote): Held that the word "amend" implies retaining the core identity. You cannot change the Constitution so much that it loses its identity.
- **Justice Sikri (CJ)**: Listed supremacy, democracy, secularism as basic features.

## Significance
- **Check on Absolute Power**: Prevented Parliament from becoming a supreme authority that could rewrite the entire Constitution (saving India from potential dictatorship).
- **Judicial Review**: Established the Judiciary as the final interpreter of what constitutes the "Basic Structure".
- **Stability**: Ensured that the core values of the Constitution remain permanent while allowing flexibility for other changes.

## Subsequent Application
- **Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain (1975)**: Basic structure used to strike down 39th Amendment.
- **Minerva Mills v. Union of India (1980)**: Struck down parts of 42nd Amendment, reinforcing judicial review and balance between Fundamental Rights and DPSP as basic features.

## Practical Note
In legal research, any constitutional amendment is tested against this doctrine. If a law violates the Basic Structure, it is unconstitutional.
