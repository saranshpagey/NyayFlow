# Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan

## Citation
(1997) 6 SCC 241; AIR 1997 SC 3011

## Overview
This case recognized **Sexual Harassment at Workplace** as a violation of fundamental rights and laid down the famous **"Vishaka Guidelines"**, which served as the law until the prompt enactment of legislation in 2013.

## Facts
- Bhanwari Devi, a social worker in Rajasthan, was gang-raped for stopping a child marriage.
- The investigation was botched, and she faced immense stigma.
- Women's rights groups (Vishaka) filed a PIL in Supreme Court seeking enforcement of fundamental rights for working women.

## Core Issues
- Does sexual harassment violate Fundamental Rights?
- In the absence of specific domestic law, can the Supreme Court legislate?
- Can International Conventions (CEDAW) be used to interpret Indian Constitution?

## The Judgment
The Supreme Court held:
1. **Rights Violation**: Sexual harassment violates:
   - Article 14 (Equality)
   - Article 19(1)(g) (Right to practice any profession)
   - Article 21 (Right to Life and Dignity)
2. **International Law**: In the absence of domestic law, International Conventions (like CEDAW - Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women) can be read into the Fundamental Rights.
3. **Judicial Legislation**: Under Article 141, the guidelines issued by the Court would be treated as **declared law** until Parliament enacts a statute.

## The Vishaka Guidelines
The Court mandated every employer (public and private) to follow these:
1. **Definition**: Defined sexual harassment (unwelcome physical contact, demand for sexual favors, sexually colored remarks, pornography, unwelcomed conduct).
2. **Preventive Steps**: Employers must notify prohibition of harassment.
3. **Complaints Committee**: Crucial mandate. Every workplace must have a **Internal Complaints Committee (ICC)**.
   - Headed by a woman.
   - At least 50% women members.
   - Third-party representative (NGO, etc.) to prevent pressure.
4. **Disciplinary Action**: Harassment is misconduct; appropriate action must be taken.
5. **Criminal Proceedings**: If behavior constitutes an IPC offense, employer must initiate criminal action.

## Impact & Legacy
- filled a massive legislative vacuum.
- Recognized the right to a safe working environment.
- Directly led to the enactment of the **Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act)**, which replaced these guidelines but largely codified them.

## Key Principles
- **Gender Equality**: Sexual harassment is not just a personal injury but a discrimination issue preventing women's participation in work.
- **Employer Liability**: Shifted responsibility to employers to ensure safety (Vicarious Liability concept).

## Current Status
The Guidelines are now superseded by the **POSH Act, 2013**, but the judgment remains the jurisprudential foundation for workplace dignity in India.
