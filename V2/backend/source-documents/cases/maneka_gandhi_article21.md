# Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India

## Citation
(1978) 1 SCC 248; AIR 1978 SC 597

## Overview
A landmark judgment that expanded the scope of **Article 21** (Right to Life and Personal Liberty). It transformed Article 21 from a mere protection against executive action to a substantative protection requiring laws to be "just, fair, and reasonable."

## Facts
- Maneka Gandhi's passport was impounded by the government under the Passports Act, 1967 "in public interest".
- No reasons were provided.
- She challenged this as violating Article 14 (Equality), 19 (Freedom), and 21 (Life & Liberty).

## Core Issues
1. Is the Right to Travel Abroad part of "Personal Liberty" under Article 21?
2. Does "Procedure established by law" (Art 21) mean ANY law enacted by Parliament, or must the law be fair and reasonable?
3. Relationship between Articles 14, 19, and 21.

## The Judgment
The 7-judge bench held:
1. **Expanded Personal Liberty**: "Personal Liberty" is a wide concept holding many rights. Right to travel abroad is part of it.
2. **Due Process Introduced**: The Court rejected the narrow interpretation of *A.K. Gopalan (1950)*. It held that "Procedure established by law" must not be arbitrary, fanciful, or oppressive. It must be **"fair, just, and reasonable"**.
   - This effectively imported the American concept of "Due Process of Law" into India.
3. **Golden Triangle**: Established the inter-connectedness of Articles 14, 19, and 21. A law depriving liberty must satisfy all three:
   - Must be a valid law (Art 21).
   - Must not violate equality (Art 14).
   - Must not violate freedoms (Art 19).
4. **Natural Justice**: Even administrative actions (like impounding passport) must follow principles of natural justice (Audi Alteram Partem - right to be heard), even if the statute doesn't explicitly say so.

## Significance
- **Procedure Established by Law**: Changed meaning from "Any enacted law" -> "Just and Fair Law".
- **Human Rights**: Paved the way for recognizing various unenumerated rights under Art 21 (Right to Privacy, Clean Environment, Livelihood, Speedy Trial, etc.).
- **Checks on Legislature**: Courts can now judge the "reasonableness" of a law, not just its procedural enactment.

## Impact on Rights
Post-Maneka Gandhi, Article 21 became the "repository" of human rights in India.
- **Right to Privacy** (Puttaswamy case)
- **Right to Education** (Unni Krishnan case)
- **Right to Livelihood** (Olga Tellis case)
All trace their roots to the expansive interpretation given here.

## Summary Quote
*Justice Krishna Iyer*: "Law is not a 'law' if it is arbitrary... Procedure is not 'procedure' if it is unreasonable... Law must be right, just and fair, not arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive."
